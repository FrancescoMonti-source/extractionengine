# Collaboration & handoff log

This repo is the **shared coordination layer** between the human owner and AI
collaborators. It exists so no collaborator depends on its own chat memory —
anyone can re-enter cold by reading `DESIGN.md` and this file.

## Protocol

- **Roles.** The human owns product and clinical decisions. AI collaborators
  **both draft and review** (mutual, not one-directional). The human remains the
  decision-maker and coordinates exchanges when collaborators do not share a
  session.
- **Source of truth.** `DESIGN.md` = target architecture and vocabulary
  (§16 = deferred capabilities gated on a consumer). `HANDOFF.md`
  (this file) = the review/coordination frame and chronological log.
- **Current implementation plan.** See [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md).
- **Handoff format** (every exchange): *Goal & acceptance criteria · proposed
  change + reasoning · files changed · open questions/uncertainties.*
- **No rubber-stamping.** State disagreements explicitly with the tradeoff.
  Responses land **in the repo** (update `DESIGN.md` or append a log entry here),
  not only in chat — so the decision and its reasoning survive compaction.
- **Decisions** get recorded in `DESIGN.md` when they change the target
  contract (including §16 when they only shift a deferred capability's
  status or consumer), once the human accepts them.

## Executor overhaul + CCAM act_channel + prototype purge -- Claude (2026-07-01)

Big session on the `channel-shape` branch (11 commits, green throughout, ending at 68 tests).
Two threads: a scaffolding purge, then the source-roles/channel-shape build.

**Framing established (memory `product-is-the-engine-not-concepts`):** this is NOT a clinical
study. The product is the generic concept-agnostic engine (DESIGN §1). Everything
concept-specific -- `R/concepts-*`, `R/adapter_*`, `R/types/*`, `scripts/*_real.R`,
exploration scripts -- is removable scaffolding, kept only while it validates the engine.

**Purged (~2,100 lines):** the pre-`run_variable` prototype run path -- `scripts/run_structured.R`
+ the `measure_diabetes`/`measure_hyperkalaemia` clinical wrappers + `concepts-hyperkalaemia.R`
+ the `run_structured_measurement`/`.structured_execution_error`/`build_structured_review_view`
helpers; `scripts/run_synthesis.R` (text-side twin, bypassed run_variable) + its orphaned
`build_review_view`; 7 concluded round/phase exploration scripts. Folded each concept's Lucene
query into its concept file and deleted `adapter_smoking.R` (kept `adapter_anastomoses.R` for
its still-used `load_tasks`; deleted its orphaned `_eligibility`). `scripts/` is now just the
3 `run_variable_*_real.R` validation runs + `check_grammar_enforcement.R`. `run_variable_*_real`
are the real-model-on-real-data validation harness (they ARE the validation story; the unit
suite is only tripwires) -- kept while validating, will collapse to one generic driver later.

**Executor overhaul (structured.R 575 -> 402):** internalized channel `produces`; collapsed the
whole-history code executor into a window-optional `measure_code_presence`; then made it
source-agnostic and added the CCAM/act path (owner: "ccam channel is a must have, I filter on
$CODEACTE"):
- Matching is now **exact (a code set) or regex (per-pattern)**, replacing prefix-only
  `code_in_family`. Codes normalized (dots/spaces stripped). `icd10()` takes a regex (DESIGN's
  `icd10("^E1[0-4]")`) or `match="exact"`; new `ccam()` defaults exact. Concept selectors
  migrated (diabetes `icd10("^E1[0-4]")`, dialysis `match="exact"`).
- **Dropped `.usable_icd10_code` + the usable/invalid/field_validity/n_usable apparatus for
  codes** -- HDW codes are standardized by redsan, so usability checks are cruft (the LLM
  accept-only-valid pattern leaking onto deterministic channels; memory
  `hdw-standardized-no-validity-checks`). It was also the ICD-10 coupling blocking CCAM.
- **Role-aware:** `data.R` gains `ACTE_SOURCE` (pmsi$actes: CODEACTE=code, point DATEACTE) and
  `EE_SOURCES` (channel-source-name -> spec registry). `.code_source_binding()` resolves the
  code column + point/interval time from the source's roles; unregistered sources fall back to
  the pmsi$diag shape. `pmsi$diag` output byte-compatible; `code`/`act` share one dispatch arm.
- Params renamed: `source_table`, `code_col`/`start_col`/`end_col`. New floor-worthy test
  `test-slice-act-channel-spec.R` (CCAM exact match over synthetic pmsi$actes, point window).

**Open follow-ups (none blocking):** (1) lab usability -- `measure_analyte_value`'s
`usable = !is.na(value)`/`invalid` is the same cruft (numeric in NUMRES, qualitative in STRRES
which BIOL_SOURCE doesn't read); mirror the code cleanup. (2) output-constructor aliases --
concepts still use legacy `binary_output`/`categorical_output`/`fields_output`; migrate to
`bin_output`/`cat_output`/`struct_output` then delete the aliases (+ `llm_after_lucene(top_n)`
-> `candidate_selection`). (3) rename `measure_analyte_value`'s first param for parity.
The `channel-shape` branch now carries the whole overhaul -- worth merging as one unit before
the next thread.

## 2026-07-01 -- lab executor cleanup, plain-function reducers, output-vocab migration

Continuation on `channel-shape` (five commits, suite green at **68** throughout). Closes all
three open follow-ups from the entry above.

**Lab executor de-crufted (`8b2c6c7`):** removed `measure_analyte_value`'s
`usable = is_target & !is.na(value)` / `invalid` apparatus (+ `field_validity`/`validity_reason`/
`n_usable`/`n_unusable`) -- the same standardized-HDW cruft stripped from the code path (numeric
results are NUMRES, qualitative are STRRES which `BIOL_SOURCE` doesn't read, so `!is.na()` guards
nothing). Also deleted the now-orphaned `threshold`/`above_threshold`/`n_above`/present-absent
machinery: hyperkalaemia was deleted and `run_variable` never passed a threshold, so it was all
dead. Memory `hdw-standardized-no-validity-checks` updated (lab now done, not pending).

**Reducer is a plain function, not an operator (`8947670`):** owner -- *"i dont want ad hoc
functions for trivial stuff when i could just ask the reduce of the lab channel to do
`function(x) max(x, na.rm=T)`"*. `max_value()` was **decorative**: the lab dispatch ignored the
declared reducer and hard-coded `max` in the executor. Now:
- `measure_analyte_value` -> **`measure_analyte_values`**: it SCOPES candidate rows and returns
  `candidates` (`task_id, source_row_id, value`); it does NOT reduce.
- `.single_numeric_variable` pulls the channel's **reducer function** off the activation
  (`use_channel(reducer = function(x) max(x, na.rm = TRUE))`) and applies it to the candidate
  values; a numeric output with no reducer function errors.
- Deleted `max_value()`. `min`/`mean`/`latest`/`count` now need no operators -- they are base R.
- **Evidence = every in-window candidate** (the inputs the reducer saw), because the executor is
  reducer-agnostic (a generic `function(x)` picks no row; `mean` matches none). Diabetes slice
  test updated to assert both glucose rows are evidence; value `9.4` still `max(6.1, 9.4)`.
- Memory: new `reducers-are-plain-functions`.

**Output constructors migrated + aliases deleted (`2000601`):** the four concepts now call
`bin_output`/`cat_output`/`struct_output` directly; the legacy
`binary_output`/`number_output`/`categorical_output`/`fields_output` aliases are **removed**.
Internal `$kind` (binary/number/categorical/fields) unchanged, so runner dispatch is untouched.
`spec.R`'s hit-set error message + MIGRATION.md updated.

**Dead `top_n` deleted (`003b4a7`):** `llm_after_lucene(top_n=)` was set-but-not-read (text is
pre-retrieved; nothing read `$top_n`). Per defer-infra the owner chose to DELETE it rather than
carry it or replace it with another unread seam. `llm_after_lucene()` now takes no argument. The
target selection helper is named **`llm_candidate_selection()`** (owner renamed it off the design
doc's `candidate_selection()` to avoid ambiguity with the new STRUCTURED `candidates` frame); it
is **reserved, not built** -- add `candidates = llm_candidate_selection(arrange, limit)` inside
the method only when retrieval runs in-engine and has a consumer. Recorded in
`proposed-design-v2-deltas`.

**Param parity (`66f2246`):** `measure_analyte_values`' first param `biol` -> `source_table`
(matches `measure_code_presence`); internal transmuted frame stays `biol`.

The `channel-shape` branch is ready to land as one unit; no open follow-ups outstanding from
this thread.

## 2026-07-01 -- Boolean-envelope demotion (drop decision / decision_state / public role)

Closes the MIGRATION.md "Boolean envelope" row; also reconciles the now-stale "Channel shape"
row (which channel-shape had already completed). Suite green at **68** throughout. The target
was already ratified in DESIGN.md (`§ boolean output`, lines ~940-991) and memory
`combine-output-naming-target-contract` -- this ships it, DESIGN needed no change.

**What the public boolean surface now is** (DESIGN §"Downstream contract" / "Overlap audit"):
- `values`: `task_id, variable, value (0/1), channel_coverage`. Dropped `decision`
  (included/excluded) and `decision_state` (always "determined"). Rationale: observed set
  algebra is always determined, and included/excluded is a *presentation recoding* of `value`
  for cohort selection, not a generic engine field. Uncertainty lives in `channel_coverage`.
- `channel_status` / `membership` / `evidence`: dropped the public `role`
  (asserted/negated/mixed) column. A channel observes only its own hit; its logical position
  in the expression lives in `combine_rule`, not as a per-channel property.
- `overlap`: now groups on the pattern-determined **`value`** (0/1) + `channel_coverage`
  instead of `decision` + `decision_state`. Still one row per membership pattern, NA preserved,
  ggupset/UpSetR-pivotable.

**Dead code removed with its only consumer** (`defer-infra-until-consumer`): the polarity
`roles` field on the `hit_set_expr` combiner (`operators.R`) fed *only* the public `role`
column via `role_of()`. Both gone, and the orphaned `.hitset_expr_roles()` walker in
`hitset.R` deleted. `hit_set_difference()` builds `a & !b` strings directly (never used the
walker), so sugar-lowering is unaffected. DESIGN §989 still reserves internal polarity
derivation for a future sugar consumer -- re-derive from the AST if one appears.

**Not a public-surface change but touched:** `hit_set_overlap()` signature
`(wide, channels, decision, decision_state, channel_coverage)` -> `(wide, channels, value,
channel_coverage)`.

**Channel-shape row reconciled:** `produces` is already derived from the channel `type` inside
the `channel()` constructor (never user-written; read once at assembly for `selected_channels`),
and `act_channel()` + `ccam()` over `pmsi$actes` ship. Both of that row's tasks were done on
channel-shape; MIGRATION.md just hadn't been updated.

**No test churn:** `test-slice-hitset-expr-spec.R` already asserted only `value` +
`channel_coverage` + raw `membership$hit` (its header even said "without exposing migration-era
decision_state/role"), so the floor test proves the demotion without edits. `mean(value)`
semantics unchanged.

**Files:** `R/hitset.R`, `R/operators.R`, `R/run_variable.R`, `MIGRATION.md`, `HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-07-01 -- Source-roles: prune dead legacy_roles + reconcile the row (lab binding deferred)

Investigated the MIGRATION.md "Source registry and roles" row (owner thought it was already
done; it was *mostly* done). Findings, then a scoped cut. Suite green at **68**.

**State found (most of the row had already landed):** `source_spec()` carries the canonical role
map (`subject_id`/`event_id`/`source_item_id`/`code`/`analyte`/`value_num`/`value_str`/`date`/
`event_start`/`event_end`/`document_type`/`source_result_id`); `EE_SOURCES` registers docs/diag/
actes/biology; and the **code/act executor is fully role-driven** -- `.code_source_binding()`
([run_variable.R]) resolves the code column + point/interval time from the source's roles, which
is exactly why `pmsi$diag` (code col `diag`) and `pmsi$actes` (code col `CODEACTE`) share one
`measure_code_presence()` executor.

**The `legacy_roles` apparatus was fully dead** and was removed (owner picked "prune + reconcile
only"): nothing called `source_roles(..., include_legacy = TRUE)`, so the migration-era alias
labels (subject/event/record/interval_start/... ) had zero consumers. Deleted the `legacy_roles`
param on `col()`, the `legacy_roles` field on the col struct + on `source_spec`, the
`include_legacy` branch in `.source_role_map()` and `source_roles()`, and all `legacy_roles = ...`
declarations across DOCS/DIAG/BIOL/ACTE sources. `col()`/`source_roles()` are now single-purpose.
Migration to the target vocab is complete, so the inspectable back-compat labels earned nothing.

**Deferred, with the reason recorded in the row (`defer-infra-until-consumer`):**
- `.lab_source_binding()` -- the lab executor `measure_analyte_values()` still names biology
  columns directly (`DATEXAM`/`analyte`/`value`/`value_raw`/`BIOL_ID`). The code path is
  role-driven because it *had* to be (two coded sources, different code columns); biology has a
  **single source**, so there is no second consumer forcing role-resolution. Add the binding
  when a second biology source appears. NOT built speculatively.
- Source-registry auto-seeding: NOT a thing. `redsan` (v0.1.0) exposes only `get_edsan`,
  `process_pmsi`, `process_biol` -- there is no source-registry API to seed from, and auto-seeding
  is not planned. Source specs are and stay hand-declared (`EE_SOURCES`).

**Design note:** output frames deliberately keep physical/runner column names. "Executors consume
roles" means the executor resolves physical names *from* the spec's roles (as the code path does),
NOT that normalized frames get renamed to role names. The other declared-but-unread source_spec
metadata (`module`/`table`/`identifiers`/`query_date_keys`/`default_batch_key`/`normalizer`) was
KEPT -- DESIGN §4 enumerates it as legitimate redsan-shaped source metadata, unlike the
migration-only `legacy_roles`.

**No test churn:** `test-slice-source-spec-roles.R` already asserted the role→column map with
target names only (no legacy path), so it proves the map still resolves after the prune.

**Files:** `R/data.R`, `MIGRATION.md`, `HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-07-01 -- LLM boundary: investigated + reconciled the row (already functionally satisfied)

Investigated the MIGRATION.md "LLM boundary" row (same pattern as source-roles: find out how much
is already satisfied before touching anything). Verdict: the who-owns-what boundary is **already
implemented and shipped on both sides**; the row's "align method declarations and provenance" is
purely a declarative-surface refactor that duplicates the Text-method row's deferred work. Doc-only
reconciliation, no code. Suite green at **68**.

**Boundary mapped against the code (every responsibility is already in place):**
- *ellmer owns* the structured call (`make_ollama_caller` -> `chat$chat_structured(prompt, type)`)
  and type validation/parsing (`ellmer::type_from_schema()` builds the type; ellmer validates the
  response and returns a parsed R list).
- *engine owns* everything else via the per-task-isolated `run_extraction` loop: candidate
  selection (text pre-retrieved), prompt rendering (`prompt_builder`), evidence-ID validation
  (`resolve_cited_ids()` real-vs-invented + `.materialize_task_evidence()` exactly-one-snippet
  assert), response-to-hit mapping (parser `normalized_value` `documented`->`present` ->
  `.reduce_channel_result` -> `isTRUE(r$hit)`), and provenance (`attempts`: model/seed/
  prompt+schema+query hashes/finish-reason/raw response, plus evidence + `channel_status`).

**Two confirmations that pin down "nothing to build here now":**
- `llm_after_lucene()` / `method` is **set-but-not-read at execution** -- grep of
  run_variable/channel-combine/extract found zero reads. The text arm dispatches on
  `channel_def$type == "text"` and consumes `extractor` (the definition bundle), never `method`;
  `method` is surfaced only by `inspect()`. Reserved declarative surface (like `produces` was),
  NOT dead alias apparatus like `legacy_roles` -- so it stays (it's the documented public tag).
- `positive_hit_when` exists **only in DESIGN.md/HANDOFF.md, never in `R/`**. Response-to-hit
  mapping is presently the binary parser's `documented`->`present`->hit.

**The only unaligned part (deferred, `defer-infra-until-consumer`):** DESIGN §488 wants the
method-specific knobs (`prompt`/`type`/`candidates`/`positive_hit_when`) folded INTO the
`llm_after_lucene(...)` signature instead of the `definition`/`extractor` bundle. That is the SAME
reserved-not-built work as the Text-method row -- gated on in-engine retrieval + a consumer.
`positive_hit_when` in particular is only worth building when a variable needs a response-to-hit
mapping the parser doesn't already bake in. No consumer today, so not built.

**No test churn:** doc-only reconciliation of the MIGRATION row; execution paths untouched.

**Files:** `MIGRATION.md`, `HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-07-01 -- Whole-history text: generic no-window subject eligibility (validated by a disposable variable_spec)

Owner named a consumer (whole-history depression) to unblock the "Whole-history text" row. Two
corrections mid-slice (owner): (1) do NOT build a depression concept -- "whole-history depression"
is JUST a `variable_spec` a study author writes; the engine only needs the GENERIC capability, and
the validating variable_spec is a **disposable test probe**, not shipped machinery. (2) Apply the
prune-tests filter to the probe: the first draft added 7 assertions; only ONE survives the filter
(see below). Suite green at **69** (68 -> 69, +1 assertion; no regressions).

**Generic engine change (the only real gap):** `.retrieve_text_channel` handled event-linkage and
subject+window, but *errored* on subject-linkage with no window. Added a whole-history branch: no
window -> scope the subject's ENTIRE document record (join `docs_index` by `PATID`, no `RECDATE`
filter), the text mirror of the whole-history code path. Whole-history tasks carry no `anchor_date`,
so none is joined (it rides through `retrieve()` as an NA `days_from_anchor` ranking column,
meaningless here). Nothing concept-specific.

**Validation = a disposable variable_spec run through the public surface:** the whole-history slice
test ([test-slice-whole-history-spec.R]) poses a whole-history TEXT demand as a variable_spec
(`window = NULL` over the EXISTING diabetes text channel) + a corpus fixture + fake caller, and runs
it via `run_variable()`. This mirrors the existing whole-history *structured* `wh_variable()` probe.
The variable_spec is test-local -- no concept/template added to `R/`.

**Pruned to the one distinguishing invariant:** the single assertion is `value[["Q4"]] == 1L` for a
subject whose ONLY note is from 2005 -- reachable only when the whole record is in scope (a broken or
reverted no-window branch errors or applies a window that drops the note -> value 0; `value == 1`
also implies real grounding, since binary presence is invalid without a resolved evidence id). The
first draft also asserted recent-mention->present, no-document->`partial`, and evidence-ref grounding;
all three duplicate invariants already guarded by `test-slice-retrieval-wiring.R` and the structured
whole-history test above, so they were cut per [[prune-tests-to-target-invariants]].

**Discipline reaffirmed:** validate an engine capability by writing the throwaway variable_spec a
user would write (TDD from the public surface), NOT by shipping a concept. The variable_spec reveals
the true generic gap; if it had run green untouched, the row would have been already-satisfied.

**Files:** `R/run_variable.R`, `tests/testthat/test-slice-whole-history-spec.R`, `MIGRATION.md`,
`HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-07-02 -- Alignment audit: working model had drifted from DESIGN.md (owner asked to check)

A long design conversation (grain/level naming, per-channel "what counts as a hit" predicate,
`index_event` derived anchor, channel-override at the variable_spec). Before capturing it as
"decisions," audited against DESIGN.md -- and found MOST of it is ALREADY the ratified contract; I had
drifted by reasoning from the CODE (where these are dead/unwired) instead of DESIGN, and told the
owner "unit is dead" when DESIGN says the opposite. Owner was right to be surprised. No engine code
written; this entry + memories are the deliverable.

**Already specified in DESIGN, code lags (the gap is wiring, not design):**
- **unit IS the grain** -- §7 "Grain is the `unit`", first-class, takes the group-by
  (`unit = "PATID"` / `transplant_unit()`). Code: `unit` set-but-not-read, grain implicit in the
  tasks frame.
- **local selector/field override at activation** -- §14.3 (the owner's exact type-2 example) +
  "any field in `use_channel()` replaces the inherited field; a supplied selector replaces it
  locally, does not mutate the concept." Code: selector read from `channel_def`, not the activation.
- **lab hit-predicate** -- §8: unthresholded lab = presence hit; `analyte_value("GLU.GLU", gt = 11)`
  = threshold hit. A target, not banned -- only the dead impl was removed (memory
  `hdw-standardized-no-validity-checks` corrected accordingly).
- **event-derived anchor** -- `anchor = transplant_date()` / `surgery_date()` already derive a date
  from an event.
- **event/stay-grain structured executors** -- §7 (~line 570) explicitly names this as THE current
  migration gap (text resolves event scope; code/lab don't). = the "Event/stay grain" MIGRATION row.
- **grain-agnostic combine over mixed channels** -- §7 `combine = "text_diabet & glucose"` means
  different things at patient vs stay grain -- essentially the diabetes AND example, already in the doc.

**Genuinely new (not generic in DESIGN):** `index_event` -- a GENERIC derived anchor (find the event
matching a code selector, anchor at its date-role), generalizing the domain constructors
`transplant_date()`/`surgery_date()`. Single-match for now (multi-match -> `candidate_selection`).
Prerequisite is a redsan change (denormalize the stay envelope onto `$diag`/`$actes`), then
`ACTE_SOURCE` declares `event_start`/`event_end`. Details + date-typing caveats in memory
`index-event-derived-anchor`.

**Naming (decided after the audit):** output-grain axis renamed `unit`->`output_one_row_per` (frees
`unit` for the measurement unit) -- DESIGN's "Grain is the `unit`" made explicit; rationale is the
fill-and-tweak boilerplate-R-snippet authoring model (memory `variable-spec-boilerplate-explicit-names`).
Channel attachment (`linkage`) named `level` (ratified 2026-07-02).

**Takeaway (memory `design-is-source-of-truth-code-lags`):** read DESIGN before proposing engine
"design"; the gap is usually the code lagging the contract.

## 2026-07-02 -- Reduce/combine composition + deferred `where` filter axis; naming ratified

Clarified (grounded in DESIGN §8 validity matrix) that `reduce` and `combine` NEVER co-occur in one
variable: `combine` produces 0/1 (bin) only; a `num`/`str`/`cat`/`struct` output needs
`combine = NULL`. So "mean Hb for the text&lab-anemia cohort" is TWO independent columns -- a
`bin`+combine cohort and a `num`+reducer value -- composed by a DOWNSTREAM row-filter
(`value[cohort == 1]`), NOT a spec sequence/dependency (that fear was a misread; the columns are
independent). Corrected my own earlier framing: "combine-gated numeric" is NOT a missing capability;
DESIGN excludes it on MECHANICS -- the §8 validity matrix makes `combine` 0/1 (`bin`) only -- NOT
because cohorts are out of scope (they are core: inclusion + extraction IS the engine's job; §955
names cohort *selection* as the use-case `value` serves; §15's out-of-scope item is cohort
*governance*). [corrected 2026-07-02, see below] The lab side of the cohort
still needs the §8 lab hit-predicate (`analyte_value(gt/lt ...)` → hit), which IS the real unwired gap.

Owner WANTS the one-spec form eventually -- `num_output(mean Hb) where (text_anemia & lab_anemia)`, a
`where`/filter axis -- but is HOLDING it (two-column pattern works; add when it hurts). Recorded as a
deferred design axis: memory `where-filter-dimension-deferred`.

Naming ratified: **`output_one_row_per`** (output grain, frees `unit` for measurement unit) +
**`level`** (per-channel attachment, was DESIGN's `linkage`).

**Files:** `HANDOFF.md`; memories `where-filter-dimension-deferred`, `variable-spec-boilerplate-explicit-names`,

## 2026-07-02 -- Engine scope clarified + channel-override at activation shipped

**Scope correction (owner).** We ARE doing electronic-cohort work -- **inclusion (who qualifies) +
data extraction (what values) is the engine's whole job.** Out of scope is the layer ABOVE: analysis,
cohort GOVERNANCE, study-lifecycle/platform (DESIGN §15: "a higher research platform may later use this
engine"). I had drifted and written "cohort selection is out of scope" (memory + the HANDOFF line
corrected just above): that misread §15 (which lists cohort *governance*, not selection) and §955
(which names cohort *selection* as the very use-case `value` serves; §1193 treats cohort membership as
first-class engine correctness). Consequence: the deferred `where` axis is held on **mechanics**
(combine->0/1), not scope -- gating a value by an inclusion is squarely our job. New memory
`engine-scope-inclusion-and-extraction`.

**Slice: channel-override at activation (DESIGN §14.3).** `use_channel(selector = ...)` now locally
overrides a concept's baseline channel selector for ONE variable, without mutating the concept. The
execution path (`.run_selected_channel`) already did inline `activation %||% concept` for `extractor`;
`selector` now follows the SAME pattern -- resolved ONCE at the top and used by every branch
(code/act/lab/text extraction), AND threaded into `.resolve_text_inputs`/`.retrieve_text_channel` so a
text override applies to BOTH retrieval and extraction. (A half-applied selector would retrieve on the
baseline query but match/extract on the override -- a silent correctness bug; that's why the seam is
uniform, not just the code branch the probe exercises.) `selector` promoted to a first-class
`use_channel()` param (was riding `...`), per boilerplate-explicit-names + DESIGN §14.3's own
`use_channel(selector = lucene_query(...))`.

NB the earlier plan ("wire through `.inherit_from_activation` like reducer/extractor") was modeled on
the WRONG path: that helper feeds only `inspect()`/`resolve_variable_spec`; the EXECUTOR reads the
concept channel directly and resolves overrides inline with `%||%`. Followed the code, not the memory.

**Probe (disposable, in-test).** One E13 subject; same spec run twice -- baseline `icd10("^E1[0-4]")`
hits (1), local override `icd10("^E1[0-2]")` misses (0). The contrast is the only proof the activation
selector -- not the concept's -- drove the executor. Suite 69 -> 71 (one test, two discriminating
assertions; passes the prune filter -- no other test protects the §14.3 override invariant).

**Files:** `R/spec.R` (use_channel selector param), `R/run_variable.R` (uniform selector resolution +
text threading), `tests/testthat/test-slice-channel-override-spec.R`, `HANDOFF.md`; memories

## 2026-07-02 -- Event/stay-grain structured executor (code/act): EVTID scope + numeric count

Closes the code/act half of the DESIGN §7 (~line 570) executor-wiring gap. `measure_code_presence`
(the neutral code + act membership executor) now does two additive things:

1. **Stay-grain scoping.** Grain comes from the SUPPLIED TASK UNIVERSE (DESIGN §7: "one output row
   per unit in the supplied task universe"), and it is carried PER TASK -- each task row says which
   subject AND which stay it is. So when the tasks frame carries a non-NA `EVTID` (stay grain), the
   executor scopes evidence by `c(PATID, EVTID)` instead of `PATID` alone; patient-grain tasks (no
   EVTID column) keep the subject-only join. `source_counts`/coverage group by the same `grain_keys`.
   Important framing: the engine does NOT group-by a column internally -- the caller supplies tasks
   pre-grained (one task_id per unit) and the executor scopes each task's evidence; the per-task
   reducer is the "summarise within grain."

2. **Numeric count over a structured channel.** The executor now also returns `candidates` (one row
   per matching source row, `value = 1L`). A `num_output()` over a code/act channel with
   `use_channel(reducer = function(x) length(x))` then counts them via the EXISTING numeric assembly
   (`.single_numeric_variable`). No bespoke count operator -- "reducers are plain functions"
   (`length`/`sum` both give the count). The membership face (`values`: present/absent) is unchanged;
   both faces ride the same result list.

**Probe (disposable, in-test).** Patient P1, two stays: EV1 = 2 matching CCAM acts (JAFA001) + 1 decoy
(HGPC015); EV2 = 1 matching act. Stay-grain tasks (`window = NULL`, event-scoped). EV1 counts 2, EV2
counts 1 -- a PATID-only join would give BOTH 3 (each stay would see all of P1's matches), so the
values are the proof of EVTID scoping; the decoy proves count = matching-and-in-stay. Suite 71 -> 73.

**Decisions / deferred (flag for ratification):**
- **`output_one_row_per` NOT wired this slice.** Grain is task-frame-driven (the correct locus: each
  task carries its own subject+stay), so no param is needed for the executor to scope correctly.
  `unit` remains stored-but-unread. Renaming `unit`->`output_one_row_per` AND giving it a job (a
  validation guard: "the task frame's task_id is 1:1 with the declared grain column, and carries it")
  is a clean SEPARATE slice -- doing the rename now is label->column churn across ~8 disposable test
  files without a consumer. Recommend deferring; easy to add.
- **Lab executor still PATID-only.** `measure_analyte_values` needs the identical `grain_keys` change
  for stay-grain labs; deferred (no lab-stay-grain consumer/probe yet -- avoid untested code). A
  mixed code+lab variable at stay grain would currently scope code by stay but lab by subject; no such
  variable exists yet, and the first one written would catch it via its own probe. Documented so it's
  not forgotten.
- **Count of an empty stay = NA, not 0.** `.single_numeric_variable` short-circuits empty candidates
  to NA/partial (right for max/mean, debatable for count). The probe only asserts non-empty stays.
  Count-identity (0-fill) is a deferred question; a fix would let the reducer own the empty case
  (always call it) but that touches the max-glucose NA expectation -- out of scope here.

## 2026-07-02 -- `output_one_row_per` wired: grain is a declared, guarded, executor-driving axis

Gives the output-grain axis a real job (was `unit`, stored-but-unread). `variable_spec(unit=)` is
RENAMED to `variable_spec(output_one_row_per=)` -- a concrete grain COLUMN (default "PATID"), e.g.
`output_one_row_per = "EVTID"` for stay grain. This is DESIGN §7's "Grain is the `unit`" made explicit
and, per the ratified naming, frees `unit` for the measurement unit (`analyte_value(unit=)`).

Three things now hang off it:
1. **Drives structured scoping.** `run_variable` computes `grain_keys = unique(c("PATID",
   output_one_row_per))` and threads it to `measure_code_presence` (which lost its EVTID column-
   sniffing from the previous slice -- the declaration is now authoritative, one source of truth).
   "PATID" -> subject scope; "EVTID" -> `c(PATID, EVTID)` stay scope.
2. **Guarded.** `.check_output_grain` (in `run_variable`, up front) enforces DESIGN §7's linkability
   check: the grain column(s) are present in the tasks frame, non-NA, and the grain-key combination
   is UNIQUE across tasks (one output row per unit -- 1:1 task<->unit). Clear errors otherwise.
3. **Lab loud-guard.** `measure_analyte_values` is still PATID-only, so the lab branch now ERRORS if
   run at non-PATID grain rather than silently mis-scoping (subject labs leaking into every stay).
   Converts the deferred-lab gap from a silent-wrong into a loud-unsupported.

Framing kept straight: the engine does NOT group-by a column internally. The caller supplies the task
universe already at grain (one task_id per unit); `output_one_row_per` DECLARES which column that is,
drives evidence scoping, and is validated against the frame. The per-task reducer is the "summarise
within grain."

**Migration:** all 14 `unit =` call sites -> `output_one_row_per =`. Every one was a patient-grain
fixture (the "surgery"/"transplant" labels were the ANCHOR event, not the output grain; anastomoses'
EVTID is channel linkage, not grain) so all became "PATID"; only the event-stay probe is "EVTID". No
`$unit` reads existed. `unit` is removed from `variable_spec` (loud "unused argument" if passed).

**Probe (disposable, in-test).** `test-slice-output-grain-guard-spec.R`: declaring "EVTID" grain with
patient tasks (no EVTID column) errors; declaring "PATID" grain with a repeated PATID errors. Two
assertions, the guard's two substantive guarantees (linkability + 1:1). Suite 73 -> 75.

**Deferred still open:** lab stay-grain scoping (now loud-guarded, not silent); count-of-empty-stay =
NA not 0; `level` (channel attachment) ratified but unwired.

**Files:** `R/spec.R` (rename + validate + store + template/inspect), `R/run_variable.R`
(`.check_output_grain` guard + grain_keys threading + lab loud-guard), `R/structured.R` (grain_keys is
now a param, sniffing removed), 11 test files + 3 scripts (`unit=`->`output_one_row_per=`),

## 2026-07-02 -- index_event derived anchor: the first thing that reads `variable$anchor`

An anchor can be a task COLUMN (`anchor = "inclusion_date"`, one date supplied per task) or now
DERIVED from an event. `index_event(source, selector, at = "event_start")` (`R/operators.R`, class
`ee_index_event`) is the GENERIC derived anchor -- DESIGN §14's `transplant_date()`/`surgery_date()`
are domain-specific forms. Per subject: find the event in `source` whose `code` role matches
`selector`, take its date at role `at` ("event_start"=DATENT, "event_end", "date").

**Mechanism = an anchor-resolution PASS, not an inter-channel dependency.** New `.resolve_anchor` in
`run_variable` runs AFTER `.check_output_grain`, BEFORE channel dispatch: if `variable$anchor` is an
`ee_index_event`, it computes per-subject `(PATID, anchor_date)` and injects `anchor_date` into tasks;
then normal windowing keys off it. A string/NULL anchor passes through unchanged (caller supplied
`tasks$anchor_date`). NB `variable$anchor` was previously set-but-UNREAD (same shape as `unit` before
this session) -- `.resolve_anchor` is the first reader; existing string-anchor tests are untouched
because the pass no-ops on non-`ee_index_event`.

Probed on `pmsi_diag`, which already maps `DATENT`->`event_start` (data.R), so NO source-spec change
was needed. (ACTE_SOURCE still lacks `event_start`; the "stay with CCAM act X, anchored at its DATENT"
variant needs `ACTE_SOURCE` to map DATENT->event_start + act fixtures carrying DATENT -- deferred, no
consumer yet.)

**Probe (disposable).** Two patients, SAME measured-code date (E11 on 2024-05-20) but DIFFERENT index
events (Z94 stay starting 06-01 vs 01-01). anchor = index_event(pmsi_diag, icd10("^Z94"),
at="event_start"); 30-day before-anchor window over an E11 code channel. P1 present (1), P2 absent (0)
-- same code date, opposite outcome, so the anchor is derived per-subject. Plus a contract test:
multiple index events per subject ERROR (single-match is a deliberate boundary; silent-arbitrary would
give a wrong anchor -> wrong cohort membership invisibly). Suite 75 -> 78.

**Contracts / deferred:** single-match only (multi-match -> candidate_selection, future); a unit with
NO matching event ERRORS (every unit needs its index event -- graceful partial-cohort/NA handling
deferred); anchor resolved per SUBJECT (PATID), stay-grain index_event out of scope for now.

**Files:** `R/operators.R` (`index_event()` constructor), `R/run_variable.R` (`.resolve_anchor` pass +
call), `tests/testthat/test-slice-index-event-spec.R`, `HANDOFF.md`; memory

## 2026-07-03 -- Backfill: point_date rename + act-anchor composition probe

Two commits landed with their full rationale in commit messages only (`d20dffc`, `89b4da0`);
summarized here so HANDOFF stays the complete chronological record:

- **Time role `date` -> `point_date` (`d20dffc`).** `date` was a type name masquerading as a role
  (every temporal column is a date). `point_date` names the structural slot -- the single instant a
  point-dated record occupies -- as the honest sibling of `event_start`/`event_end`. Concept-agnostic
  by construction: the same role is worn by DATEACTE, DATEXAM, and RECDATE. Pure token rename; no
  logic keys on the literal (executors resolve dates via `source_time_*`, `.resolve_anchor` reads
  `roles[[at]]` generically).
- **Act-anchored forward-window probe (`89b4da0`).** Disposable variable_spec (test-local, not a
  shipped concept) proving three shipped-but-never-co-exercised axes compose in one realistic spec:
  act-anchored derived anchor (`index_event(pmsi_actes, ccam(), at = "point_date")`), a forward
  window (`days_after(1, 30)`), and a cross-source combine (`"pmsi_complication | redo_act"`).
  Green first try -> no engine gap; the shape was already expressible. Retires the stale
  "act-anchored variant pending" note: the act anchor needs the `point_date` role, not `event_start`.

---

## 2026-07-03 -- DESIGN reconciled to two shipped ratified renames (fresh-eyes review, Claude Fable)

A cold re-entry review (README -> DESIGN -> HANDOFF tail -> code) found DESIGN.md lagging the CODE in
the non-licensed direction: §1 allows the doc to be AHEAD of the code ("states the destination
vocabulary even where code lags"), not behind it. Doc-only commit; suite green at **99** before and
after (no code touched). Also verified during the review: `outputs/` is fully gitignored (zero
tracked files), so the local run artifacts honor the no-clinical-data rule.

- **`unit` -> `output_one_row_per`** (ratified + shipped 2026-07-02) had landed in §7's grain-scoping
  paragraph but NOT in the §6 declaration list, the §6/§13/§14 examples, the §12 resolved view, §2's
  layer diagram, or invariant 12 -- so the doc used `unit` for BOTH grain (§6) and measurement unit
  (§8 `unit = "mmol/L"`), the exact ambiguity the rename was ratified to kill. All grain-meaning
  `unit` occurrences now read `output_one_row_per`; §7 retitled "Grain, anchors, windows, and
  linkage". §14's fictional `transplant_unit()`/`surgery_unit()`/`patient_unit()` constructors became
  `output_one_row_per = "PATID"`, per the shipped migration's own finding that those labels named the
  ANCHOR event, not the output grain. The `unit` payload role (labs, line ~115/`UNIT`) keeps the name
  -- that IS the freed measurement meaning.
- **`date` -> `point_date`** (`d20dffc`) had updated the §4 role vocabulary + note but missed the
  worked examples: the biology/documents `source_spec` examples and the §12 resolved view still
  mapped `date =`. Now `point_date =`.
- **§1 status paragraph described the completed migration as ongoing:** it referenced the retired
  `MIGRATION.md` and named `binary_output()`/`number_output()`/public `decision`/`decision_state` --
  all deleted 2026-07-01 -- as transitional shipped surfaces. Rewritten: migration complete,
  declared-but-unbuilt capabilities live in §16, chronological progress lives here.

Raised in the same review but NOT acted on (owner to decide): (a) the §12 five-test floor predates
~6 newer decided invariants -- stay-grain scoping in particular fits the ratified silent/decided/
invisible-to-real-validation gate and is a promotion candidate; (b) HANDOFF at ~5.5k lines no longer
supports the "re-enter cold by reading this file" premise -- consider folding closed history into an
archive and keeping protocol + current-state + recent entries.

**Files:** `DESIGN.md`, `HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-07-03 -- Floor extended to post-06-30 invariants + closed history archived (Claude Fable)

Items 4 and 5 from the same fresh-eyes review, both owner-ratified ("i agree with you
on 4 and 5 as well").

**4) §12 floor re-opened and extended.** The five-test floor was ratified 2026-06-30;
since then six slices shipped decided invariants with tests that were formally "cuttable
without ceremony". Applied the ratified gate (silent + decided + invisible-to-real-
validation) to each and promoted five invariants (six tests):

- `event-stay-grain #1` / `lab-stay-grain #1` -- grain-key (EVTID) scoping in both
  executor branches; a PATID-only join silently inflates every stay-grain value.
- `channel-override #1` -- the activation selector drives the executor (§14.3); silent
  fallback to the concept baseline mis-measures every locally-overridden variable.
- `index-event #2` -- anchor resolution fail-closed on multi-match; silently picking an
  arbitrary event shifts every window invisibly.
- `lab-threshold #1` -- thresholded-analyte tri-state (hit / measured-below-complete /
  absent-partial); a silent flip feeds wrong availability into the observed algebra.
- `whole-history #2` -- no-window eligibility reaches a document any window would
  exclude; a silently reintroduced window default removes candidates pre-review.

Deliberately NOT promoted: `output-grain-guard` (the guard failing is only harmful
jointly with a second bug -- not silent on its own) and structural/loud tests (envelope
shape, constructors). The "declined thresholded-lab test is not a gap" clause in §12 was
removed -- that shape has since shipped with §8 and its test is now floor. Provenance
remains the one open floor candidate, unchanged.

**5) HANDOFF archived for cold re-entry.** This file had grown to ~5,500 lines / 310KB --
past what "re-enter cold by reading DESIGN.md and this file" can mean in practice.
Closed history (2026-06-19 -> 2026-06-30: design-review rounds, prototype builds,
migration slices 1-6, test pruning) moved verbatim to `HANDOFF-archive.md`; this file
keeps the protocol header, a pointer, and the target-contract era (2026-07-01 onward),
now ~640 lines. Cut point rationale: the 06-30 pruning ratification is the last entry
whose full text matters less than its DESIGN §12 record; everything after it describes
the current code. Nothing was reworded in the archive; do not append there.

**Verification.** Suite green before and after: `[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 99 ]`
(doc-only change; no code touched).

## Produced-dataset provenance object shipped; floor candidate closed -- Claude Fable (2026-07-03)

**What.** Invariant 27 ("Provenance is part of the output contract, not optional
documentation") made concrete, owner-directed ("please take care of the offered
slice"). `run_variable()` output now carries `run$provenance`, a serializable
`ee_provenance` record assembled from `resolve_variable_spec()`: identity (variable /
concept / template), the RESOLVED definition (grain, anchor snapshot, window days,
combine expression, output shape, and per channel the type, source, resolved
source-role mapping, and the resolved selector WITH its origin: activation override vs
concept default), plus execution facts (model name, timestamp). Per-attempt LLM
provenance (provider/seed/prompt/schema/query hashes) already rides on
`channel_results[[ch]]$attempts` and is not duplicated. Deferred until knowable (§16
discipline): code commit, source export date, runtime settings beyond model, template
versioning.

**Bug found and fixed on the way.** `.resolve_channel_activation()` resolved
method/extractor/reducer through the activation but pinned `selector =
channel_def$selector` -- so `resolve_variable_spec()` (and anything built on it)
reported the concept BASELINE selector while the executor ran the §14.3 activation
override. Exactly the invariant-27 silent failure: values right, trail lying. The
selector now inherits like every other activation field, with `selector_source`
("activation"/"channel") exposed.

**Floor promotion (§12).** New disposable probe
`test-slice-provenance-spec.R`: #1 pins that provenance records the override
(`^E1[0-2]`, source "activation") and not the baseline (`^E1[0-4]`), plus the resolved
definition; #2 pins execution facts + resolved source-role mappings. `provenance #1`
passes the floor gate (silent; decided -- ratified today in §12; invisible to physician
review, since the values are computed correctly from the override either way) and
joins the floor. The "one open floor candidate" clause is closed in DESIGN §12.

**Files.** `R/spec.R` (selector resolution + selector_source), `R/run_variable.R`
(`.build_provenance()` + envelope field), `DESIGN.md` (§12 ratified object subsection,
floor bullet, candidate closed), `tests/testthat/test-slice-provenance-spec.R` (new).

**Verification.** Suite green: `[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 119 ]` (was 99).

## Three real-run scripts collapsed into one generic driver -- Claude Fable (2026-07-03)

**What.** `run_variable_{diabetes,smoking,anastomoses}_real.R` shared one spine
(config -> engine sourcing -> build -> real caller -> run_variable -> PHI detail to
outputs/ -> aggregate-only report) and differed only in data assembly + report shape.
Replaced by `scripts/run_variable_real.R <case>`: the spine is generic; each case is a
CASES registry entry (removable scaffolding) supplying engine_files, bounding defaults,
and build(cfg) -> {tasks, sources, spec, save_extra}. The report needed NO per-case
code: it dispatches on the run envelope (multi-channel combine -> per-channel
contribution + positive attribution over ALL channels; categorical -> levels from
spec$output$levels; fields -> per-field acceptance). Env unified: REAL_N (per-case
default), MAX_DOCS, SMOKE_SEED, DATASETS_DIR. Privacy posture unchanged: console
aggregates only, per-row PHI -> outputs/ (gitignored).

**Latent bug surfaced.** The old diabetes script's engine chain lacked `R/hitset.R`,
so it would have died at spec build ever since any_positive() started lowering to
hit_set_expr() -- evidence the copies had already drifted. The driver's base chain
includes it.

**Verified with real runs** (gemma3:4b, local Ollama): smoking REAL_N=2 (categorical,
2/2 grounded), diabetes REAL_N=2 (OR path; contribution report negative/signal +
silent, positive attributed to the code channel), anastomoses REAL_N=1 (event-scoped
fields; 5 fields valid not_documented, evidence present). Suite untouched:
`[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 119 ]`.

**Files.** `scripts/run_variable_real.R` (new), the three per-concept scripts deleted.

## The pipeline model ratified into DESIGN -- Claude Fable (2026-07-04)

**What.** A two-day design conversation (owner-driven, stress-tested on three worked
examples) is now contract text. The core reframe: a variable_spec is a declarative
recipe for a small data-science pipeline (owner's ground truth: `lab %>%
filter(EVTID %in% docs$EVTID, hb < threshold) %>% group_by(EVTID) %>%
summarise(mean(hb))`). Channels are FILTERED ROW SETS carrying the identity spine --
their rows are simultaneously membership hits and value carriers; combine is set
algebra on spine keys at a stated level producing the SURVIVING row set; the output
kind decides what happens to those rows.

**Ratified surface (DESIGN sections in parentheses).**
- `combine` -> `combine_channels` flat expr string + `combine_at_level` defaulting to
  `output_one_row_per` (SS7/SS10); exists-lift to output rows; single-channel variables
  have no combine.
- Payload invariant (SS8): `num_output(values_from =, reduce =)` -- reducer moves off
  the activation onto the output; payloads are ALWAYS post-combine, "raw" has no
  spelling; gate + unconstrained payload = two variables.
- Channels list forms (SS6): bare strings activate; use_channel() only for overrides
  (loses `source` forever and `reducer`); inline typed definers declare variable-local
  channels under non-colliding names.
- Source resolution (SS4/SS5): source_spec gains `kind`; typed definers may omit
  `source =`, resolved unique-or-error (a 2nd lab-kind source makes omission a loud
  error, never a silent default).
- Wrapper razor (invariant 33): window ctors retired -> `window = c(from, to)` days
  (`-Inf` legal, dissolving the whole-history gap); index_event multi-match ->
  `select_event` plain closure (multi-row selection ENTAILS per-event output rows,
  owner-ratified; grain guard enforces); candidate selection -> plain closure over the
  standardized candidate table (`llm_candidate_selection()` reserved name dropped).
- Identity spine upgraded to "combination substrate" (SS4); invariants 30-35 added,
  12 amended; three worked examples added (SS14.7 antecedent de cholecystectomie,
  SS14.8 SSI 6mo post spinal surgery = the combine_at_level/select_event consumer,
  SS14.9 mean Hb in anaemic stays = the values_from consumer); SS16 gains the
  "ratified surface pending wiring" backlog with named consumers.

**Why.** Every piece traces to an owner ruling in-session: the where axis was
proposed, then DISSOLVED by the pipeline reframe (no separate gate axis); the
reduce-scope question flip-flopped until the owner's dplyr line settled it
(reducer sees filtered, join-surviving rows only); channel_hits()/surviving*()
spellings and lab_anemia-as-second-channel were each rejected and the surface
re-derived. Code still speaks the previous spellings -- wiring is gated per SS16.

**Files.** `DESIGN.md` only (375 insertions, 114 deletions). Suite untouched.

## Payload outputs wired: gated cat/num read the survivors' values -- Claude Fable (2026-07-05)

**Trigger.** Stress-testing the ratified matrix with a gated-categorical consumer
(dialysis modality: gate = `dialysis_diag & dialysis_act`, level read from the
surviving act rows' CCAM family, JVJF*/JVJB*). The probe hit the spec guard
("A hit-set expression only produces a 0/1 membership value") and the owner ruled
it a remnant of the pre-pipeline model: hits are binary, but the values BEHIND
them are free -- the combine gates rows, it never produces the value.

**Ratified (DESIGN SS8).** The per-type permission rows collapse into one payload
rule: `bin_output()` lifts membership; any other output must declare its payload
(`values_from =` + `reduce =`). `cat_output(levels, values_from =, reduce =)`
joins `num_output(...)` (cat payload ratified 2026-07-05, this consumer);
str/struct behind a gate stay "revisit with a consumer". Edge rules ratified with
it: a reduce return breaking its own contract (non-numeric / outside `levels` /
not exactly one value) is a HARD error, not a review state; an empty surviving
payload behind a passing gate is NA without calling reduce; `n_payload_rows` on
the values frame records the post-combine rows actually reduced (pre-combine
counts already ride coverage).

**Wired** (SS16 lines deleted: `num_output(values_from =, reduce =)` + payload
constraint; provenance pre/post counts). At the DEFAULT `combine_at_level`
(= output grain) over the observed hit sets -- sub-output-grain evaluation still
arrives with the `combine_at_level` line (consumer 14.8), noted inline in SS16.
- `operators.R`: `num_output(values_from =, reduce =)` (reduce now required),
  `cat_output(levels, values_from =, reduce =)` (payload flavor; without reduce it
  stays the text documented-status flavor).
- `spec.R`: the old guard reworded to the payload rule; `.check_output_payload()`
  normalizes `values_from` (defaults to the sole channel; required + validated
  against activations otherwise); `use_channel(reducer =)` REMOVED and rejected
  loudly (reduction is the variable's question -> lives on the output); reducer
  dropped from activation resolution + provenance channel snapshot.
- `run_variable.R`: `.payload_values()` (a lab row's value = its measurement, a
  code/act row's value = its code, read off evidence), `.reduce_payload()`
  (contract validation), `.single_payload_variable()` (replaces
  `.single_numeric_variable`, also serves single-channel cat-over-codes),
  `.apply_gated_payload()` (gate audit untouched; only the value column changes
  meaning). Provenance output snapshot gains `values_from` + deparsed `reduce`.
- `structured.R`: the code/act `candidates` frame (value = 1L count hack) deleted
  -- its only consumer now reads codes from evidence; count = `reduce = length`.

**Tests.** 142 pass (from 119). New `test-slice-gated-cat-output.R` (the probe,
graduated): gated cat incl. researcher-closure tie-break + gate-fail NA with
silence vs ascertained-negative coverage kept distinct; gated num + n_payload_rows;
empty-payload-behind-`|` -> NA (NOT length 0 -- would conflate no-payload with
measured zero; count-identity stays a deferred question); single-channel cat
payload; build-time payload-rule errors; out-of-levels hard error. Three tests
migrated `use_channel(reducer =)` -> `num_output(reduce =)`.

## combine_at_level wired: the expression is checked per stay, exists-lifted to the output grain -- Claude Fable (2026-07-05)

**Trigger.** Owner greenlit ("we need to do both") wiring the last unwired semantic
axis of the ratified pipeline model via the SS14.8 SSI probe, before tackling the
aggregate membership predicate (SS16 item 7, HAVING shape -- still open, next).

**The probe** (`test-slice-stay-combine-spec.R`, disposable, both canonical
consumers): SS14.8 SSI -- `text_ssi & (cim10_ssi | act_revision)` at `EVTID`, one
row per `PATID`, raw-document retrieval + fake caller. The TRAP patient (text hit
in stay S1A, revision act in stay S1B) scores 0 at stay level; a default-level twin
asserts he scores 1 today, so the axis is a real discriminator and the default
cannot drift. SS14.9 anemia -- `text_anemia & hb_low` at `EVTID` pooled to `PATID`,
`num_output(values_from = "hb_all", reduce = mean)`: the mean reads ONLY qualifying
stays' rows (the non-qualifying stay's Hb 8 is out; the qualifying stay's normal 13
is in), and swapping `values_from` to `hb_low` changes which values enter the mean.
Rejection surface before wiring: `variable_spec` unused-arg on `combine_at_level`;
`analyte_value` unused-arg on `lt`; the dead-weight rule on the payload-only channel.

**Execution semantics** (recorded in SS7 under the grain section): the key universe
at a sub-output level = the UNION of keys observed by the referenced channels (no
roster of unobserved stays; `!A` is complement within observed keys). A channel's
keys are read off its HIT EVIDENCE rows -- structured evidence already carries the
spine; text hits place via the cited documents' `EVTID` threaded from `docs_index`
through eligibility -> `retrieve()` -> materialized evidence. Fail closed twice:
evidence lacking the level key, or a hit row with an empty key, is a loud error.
Task-level membership/overlap audit unchanged; per-key verdicts exposed as the
run's `combine_keys` view. Payload behind a sub-level gate is scoped to qualifying
keys (semi-join on task + key), so SS14.9's invariant holds mechanically.

**Wired** (SS16 line deleted: `combine_at_level` + exists-lift):
- `spec.R`: `variable_spec(combine_at_level =)` (+ template passthrough);
  `.check_combine_at_level()` -- needs a combine expression, must be an
  identity-spine key (PATID/EVTID/ELTID), at the output grain or finer (coarser
  would leak hits across output rows); `.check_expr_channels()` now exempts ONLY
  the payload channel (`values_from`) from the dead-weight rule, and payload
  normalization runs before the expression check.
- `run_variable.R`: `.channel_level_keys()` + the sub-level branch in
  `.hit_set_expr_variable` (vectorized eval over observed task x key pairs,
  exists-lift, `combine_keys` audit frame); `.payload_values(level =)` +
  `.apply_gated_payload` key-scoping; provenance records the EXECUTED
  `combine_at_level` (declared or defaulted; NULL without combine algebra);
  text eligibility keeps `EVTID` in all three linkage branches.
- `retrieval.R` / `extract.R`: candidates + materialized text evidence carry
  `EVTID` when the docs index does (`any_of` whitelists).
- `channels.R` / `structured.R`: `analyte_value(lt =)` (SS14.9's hb_low was the
  consumer the shipped comment reserved it for; gt and/or lt, at least one);
  lab `candidates` keep the identity spine (payload key-scoping join).

**Tests.** 161 pass (from 142), 0 fail, 0 warn. Still §16-pending on this family:
`select_event` + per-event tasks (14.8's anchor half -- the probe used
researcher-supplied anchors); lab subject-context predicates (14.9's sexe/age
threshold); the spec-layer renames (combine -> combine_channels, window ctors ->
c(from, to), channels string/inline forms) -- this slice touched the spec layer,
so their gate is due at the next natural opportunity.

## Aggregate membership predicates wired: hit if the GROUP's aggregate says so -- Claude Fable (2026-07-05)

**Trigger.** The second half of the owner's "we need to do both": SS16 item 7, the
HAVING shape, from the owner's own ask -- "hit if mean hb < 10... It's something
the engine must be capable to do" (workaround until now: precompute the aggregate
column by hand upstream).

**Spelling (proposed by me, on the channel definition, two plain params -- flag
for owner rename if the names don't sit right):**
    group_at_level  = "EVTID"                   the spine key whose groups are tested
    keep_group_when = \(v) mean(v) < 10         plain closure, group values -> one TRUE/FALSE
No wrapper (razor: the engine interprets both parts, but a ctor would add
nothing); validated for every typed channel constructor (pair required together;
spine key only; function only). Semantics = a grouped row FILTER
(`group_by(EVTID) |> filter(mean(value) < 10)`): qualifying groups keep their
ORIGINAL rows; hits/evidence/provenance point at real rows; level algebra,
exists-lift and payload consume them unchanged. SS8 (lab channels) records the
contract; SS16 item 7 deleted.

**The probe** (`test-slice-aggregate-membership-spec.R`, disposable): anaemic
stay = mean Hb < 10. Ascertained-negative vs silence kept distinct (measurements
with no qualifying group = hit FALSE/complete; no measurements = NA/partial); the
hit's evidence = ONLY the qualifying stay's rows (the mixed patient's normal stay
contributes nothing); group-filtered rows feed combine_at_level ("anaemic stay &
same-stay transfusion" discriminates same-stay vs cross-stay); contract-breaking
closure = hard error; declaration-time pair validation. Rejection surface before
wiring was the DANGEROUS kind: channel() accepted the unknown params silently and
the engine returned a WRONG cohort (mean-11.5 patient scored 1) -- exactly the
silent-wrong-member failure this slice closes.

**Wired.**
- `channels.R`: pair validation in `channel()` (all typed ctors).
- `structured.R`: `measure_analyte_values(group_at_level =, keep_group_when =)`
  -- group filter between target-marking and the presentational fields; demoted
  rows stay in observations audit ("group aggregate predicate not satisfied");
  derivation rule records the group clause.
- `run_variable.R`: lab dispatch passes the pair through; non-lab channels with
  a group predicate rejected loudly (consumer discipline); provenance channel
  snapshot gains `group_at_level` + deparsed `keep_group_when`.

**Tests.** 176 pass (from 161), 0 fail, 0 warn. Interim hand-precomputed-column
workaround no longer needed. Open on this family: subject-context predicates
(sexe/age thresholds, SS16); coded-source group predicates (loud error reserves
the seam); activation-level override of the group pair (inherit-only for now).

## Group predicate extended to every structured channel -- Claude Fable (2026-07-05)

Owner ruling ("should be wired for every channel, at some point it will be needed
100%"): `group_at_level`/`keep_group_when` now ride code/act too, via the shared
`.apply_group_predicate()` helper (structured.R). The closure sees the group's
CODES there, so frequency criteria are plain length() rules -- probe: ">=2 acts
in the SAME stay" (AM7 two acts in one stay = 1; AM8 one act in each of two
stays = 0, ascertained/complete; evidence = the qualifying stay's rows). TEXT
still refuses loudly, with the reason in the error: a text hit is an LLM answer
grounded on cited rows, so a group rule that empties the citations must overturn
the answer (ascertained absent? unevaluable?) -- fork deliberately left to a real
consumer, recorded in SS8. Suite 180/0/0.

## Spec-layer renames landed: the ratified spellings are the only spellings -- Claude Fable (2026-07-05)

Owner: "Also renames." The SS16 rename batch (gated on "next touch of the spec
layer" -- touched twice today) is done; DESIGN prose and code now agree:
- `combine` -> `combine_channels` (variable_spec formal + template defaults +
  every test/concept/script; the old name is REJECTED LOUDLY, not aliased).
- Window ctors DELETED (wrapper razor): `window = c(from_days, to_days)` is the
  only spelling -- c(0, 180) forward, c(-1825, 7) lookback+grace, c(-Inf, 0)
  unbounded lookback (rule strings switched to %g so Inf prints; executors takes
  numeric day offsets). before_anchor(days=D, grace_days=G) migrated as c(-D, G).
- Channels entry forms (SS5): `channels = c("a", "b")` plain string activations;
  named use_channel() replacements; named INLINE typed definitions
  (`hb_all = lab_channel(...)` in the variable's list -- SS14.9's shape, now
  exercised by the stay-combine probe with hb_all inline instead of on the
  concept). Inline names colliding with concept channels are rejected; the
  runner resolves defs via .channel_def() (inline-or-concept catalog).
- required_roles / native_grain were ALREADY optional declaration metadata and
  linkage already defaults to the subject path -- noted in SS16, nothing to wire.
  Source-kind resolution (channel omitting source=) remains SS16-pending: it
  needs a content-kind facet on source_spec; gate = a consumer that cannot name
  its source.

Suite 180/0/0 on the first post-migration run. Next: select_event (owner
greenlit) -- scoping rule settled by inspection: every windowed consumer is
subject-scoped, every grain-unit consumer is windowless, so per-event tasks
(windowed, EVTID identity) scope by PATID + window.

## select_event wired: the researcher's rule for which event starts the clock -- Claude Fable (2026-07-05)

Owner: "i remember that necessity and understand what select_event is doing.
Yes we should do it." The last SS16 semantic line with a 14.8 consumer.

**Surface** (as ratified, invariant 35): `index_event(source, selector, at,
select_event = <plain closure>)`. The closure sees the subject's matched event
rows (PATID, EVTID, and the date under its ROLE name, e.g. point_date) and
returns the row(s) that anchor the clock. NULL keeps today's posture: multiple
matches = loud error, the engine never picks (message now points at
select_event).

**Emission** (probe `test-slice-select-event-spec.R`): one selected event ->
anchor as before, task ids unchanged. Several selected events (e.g. identity)
-> ONE TASK PER EVENT, task_id suffixed ::EVTID, each with its own anchor and
window; output_one_row_per must name the event key -- identity under
patient-grain output fails loudly ("one task per patient"). The anchor pass now
runs BEFORE the grain guard so the guard sees the emitted universe. A closure
dropping EVTID/date columns is rejected; a closure selecting nothing = the
no-match loud error. Executed select_event rides provenance deparsed (like
reduce / keep_group_when).

**Scoping rule settled and recorded in SS7:** a declared WINDOW is the scope
(rows gather per subject inside each task's anchored window; a per-event task's
EVTID is task IDENTITY, never a row filter -- forward complications live in
LATER stays); with no window the grain unit is the scope. Verified: every
pre-existing consumer already sat on one side (windowed = subject-scoped,
grain-unit = windowless), so nothing shipped changed meaning. Probe
discriminator: same patient, same November revision -- 1 for the June surgery's
task, 0 for the March one.

**Tests.** 190 pass / 0 fail / 0 warn. SS16 semantic residue: subject-context
lab predicates (sexe/age) and source-kind resolution -- both consumer-gated.

## Cohort intake: the row universe is declared, laid down with the data -- Claude Fable (2026-07-05)

Owner alignment (three-message design dialogue): the engine runs DOWNSTREAM of a
human-validated cohort -- candidates are screened and validated one by one
BEFORE the engine (that loop = cohort governance, out of scope), so the
validated list is the universe and it arrives WITH the data. The old
researcher-built `tasks` frame demanded boilerplate (invented task_ids) that
made it smell like an LLM-pipeline leak; the FUNCTION (declared denominator)
is load-bearing, the CEREMONY was not.

**Wired** (`.resolve_cohort`, run_variable/run_variables signature):
- `run_variable(spec, sources = ...)`: universe = `sources$cohort` -- a frame
  (grain keys + optional anchor_date/attributes) or a BARE VECTOR of PATIDs
  ("a column of an .xlsx" is a valid cohort).
- `cohort =` argument = the narrowing override (inclusion chaining, stay
  rosters). Positional compatibility kept: run_variable(spec, tasks, sources)
  still works (cohort is arg 2).
- `task_id` derives from the grain keys when absent (PATID / PATID::EVTID);
  supplied ids are kept.
- No cohort anywhere = LOUD error; the universe is never inferred from data.
- `cohort_from_sources(sources)` = the EXPLICIT union-of-frames escape
  (docs_index included) for exploration -- visible choice, not silent default.

**The settling argument** (owner: "fair, point 1 is enough"): a validated
patient with no rows in any loaded source must get his NA/partial row, not
silently vanish -- pre-filtering frames can remove rejected patients but can
never ADD the trace-less member. Bonus recorded in SS7: with a declared
cohort, per-frame pre-filtering stops being a correctness invariant at all
(scoped joins never touch non-members).

**Tests.** 199 pass / 0 fail / 0 warn; new test-slice-cohort-universe-spec.R
(trace-less member keeps NA/partial; vector cohort; override narrows; loud
no-cohort error; explicit union helper; stay-grain derived ids). Open naming
question parked by owner: the `tasks` word survives internally and as the
task_id output column; renaming the COLUMN is a bigger migration, gated on
owner picking a name.

## grain_id: the public row identifier (owner pick) + run_protocol -- Claude Fable (2026-07-05)

Owner picked both names. `run_variables` -> `run_protocol` (old name rejected
loudly); the row identifier is now **grain_id** -- the id of one grain unit
(patient C1, stay C1::V1, index event P1::t::X2), i.e. "one asked-and-answered
question", named by the axis that creates it (output_one_row_per picks the
grain, grain_id identifies each unit).

**The boundary:** PUBLIC surfaces speak grain_id -- every published view
(values, evidence, membership, channel_status, combine_keys) is renamed at the
envelope (.publish_grain_id), and row-keyed public INPUTS (the cohort frame,
pre-retrieved text fixtures) may supply grain_id, normalized on intake. The
engine INTERNALS keep task_id (its original, correct text-pipeline meaning:
one extraction task); run$channel_results is the raw internal view and keeps
task_id. Tests + the real-run script migrated wholesale.

Suite 199/0/0. DESIGN SS7 records grain_id + run_protocol next to the cohort
intake; the SS9 candidate-table sketch keeps task_id deliberately (internal).

## doc_channel + date_output + index_event(at = <column>) -- Claude Fable (2026-07-07)

**Consumer named by the owner:** date of the pre-op anesthesia consult = a
document of type X from unite medicale ANES. Writing that spec (the disposable
variable_spec method) revealed the bigger gap was not the date output but the
CHANNEL: no way to say "the document's existence is the hit" without an LLM.

**Landed (probe test test-slice-doc-date-output-spec.R, 2 blocks):**

- `doc_channel(source, doc_meta(RECTYPE = ...))` -- the simplest channel kind:
  metadata-selected docs_index rows, no content/Lucene/LLM. Executor
  `measure_doc_presence` mirrors the code executor (same present/absent
  membership contract, coverage census, group predicate over doc ids);
  CANDIDATES carry value = the document's clock, spine kept. DESIGN SS5 table +
  paragraph. Document attribution columns (owner-named, same session): SEJUM =
  unite medicale, SEJUF = unite fonctionnelle -- both always present in the raw
  docs table, both declared in DOCS_SOURCE (role-less -- the engine never
  interprets them; doc_meta names them directly). The probe runs the consumer's
  FULL pick, doc_meta(RECTYPE = "CR-ANES", SEJUM = "ANES"), with a wrong-unit
  CR-ANES discriminator proving filters conjoin. NB: normalize_source PROJECTS
  to declared cols, so load_docs_index now requires SEJUM+SEJUF in the raw docs
  RDS -- re-extract if a cached index predates them.
- `date_output(values_from =, reduce =)` -- a hit row's payload value is its
  CLOCK (doc RECDATE, lab DATEXAM, code/act own start date); reduce must return
  a Date or NA (hard error otherwise: the min()-over-code-strings silent-wrong
  is exactly what this shape prevents). Rides both payload paths (single-channel
  and gated/combine, incl. combine_at_level key-scoping). DESIGN SS8 output list.
  Deliberately deferred, designed-not-wired: `at =` non-default clock override
  (waits for a DATSORT-style consumer); text channels as date payload
  (owner-ALLOWED 2026-07-07 -- researcher's vigilance, provenance not
  prohibition -- but no consumer).
- `index_event(at =)` migrated from date-role names to the source's own COLUMN
  names (owner ruling 2026-07-07: `at` is uninterpreted indirection, raw names
  are self-documenting; roles stay internal where the engine interprets them,
  e.g. windowing). `at` omitted = the source's windowing clock
  (source_time_start). select_event closures now see the native column
  (slice_min(d, DATEACTE)). Old role spellings get a pointed migration error.
  3 test files migrated; provenance records the RESOLVED column. DESIGN SS7.

Suite 191/0/0 (184 + the probe's 7 assertions).

## Subject-context lab predicate: sex/age reference ranges -- Claude Fable (2026-07-07)

**Consumer (owner, 2026-07-07):** anaemia is not a fixed Hb cutoff -- it is
Hb < 12 g/dL in women, < 13 g/dL in men, and reference ranges also vary with age
("una cosa tipica della biologia... valori uomo donna diversi e che variano con
l'età, specialmente in età pediatrica"). The owner ruled this a REAL, present-day
consumer ("l'anemia è GIÀ oggi un consumatore reale, è così che avremmo dovuto
costruirla") -- so DESIGN §16's deferred "lab value predicates with subject
context" is now built. The open sub-question there (how the subject attribute
reaches the predicate: task columns vs a demographics join) was closed by the
owner: **`PATSEX`/`PATAGE` are always carried on the raw HDW rows themselves** --
verified from the D0840 artifacts (schema-only, no PHI): `PATSEX`/`PATAGE`/`PATBD`
sit on `bio`, `pmsi$main`, `pmsi$actes`, and `docs` (only `pmsi$diag` lacks them,
which is a redsan data-prep concern, not the engine's -- the columns live on
`pmsi$main` and redsan would join them onto the diag view if ever needed there).

**Landed (probe test test-slice-lab-subject-threshold-spec.R, 3 blocks; suite 203/0/0):**

- `analyte_value(codes, keep_when = <closure>)` -- the general row predicate that
  subsumes fixed `gt`/`lt`. The closure's **formals name raw columns** on the
  analyte's rows (the measured `value` plus subject attributes the source carries,
  `PATSEX`/`PATAGE`) and returns one logical per row: the
  reducers-are-plain-functions rule extended to *membership* (the researcher's
  closure IS the rule; no sex-keyed threshold table for the engine to interpret --
  the wrapper razor). Same explicit-column convention ratified for `index_event(at =)`.
  `gt`/`lt` stay as the fixed-cutoff sugar and are **mutually exclusive** with
  `keep_when`. DESIGN §8.
- Executor: `measure_analyte_values(keep_when =)` carries the closure's extra
  column formals through the fixed transmute (row order preserved, so
  `source_table` aligns 1:1), then `.eval_row_predicate` binds formals→columns,
  evaluates over the analyte-matched rows only (so `value` is always that
  analyte's measurement), and treats an NA result as "not a hit" (same as a fixed
  bound). Contract-breaking closures are hard errors: a formal naming a column the
  source did not carry, or a result of the wrong shape/type -- the same discipline
  as `keep_group_when` and a payload `reduce`. Membership stays three-valued
  (below the sex cutoff = hit, in-range = observed FALSE, no measurement = NA).
- `BIOL_SOURCE` now declares `PATSEX` (chr) + `PATAGE` (num), **role-less** (the
  engine never interprets them; the predicate names them directly) -- the docs
  `SEJUM`/`SEJUF` pattern. NB, same caveat as that change: `normalize_source`
  PROJECTS to declared cols, so `load_biol_results()` now hard-requires
  `PATSEX`+`PATAGE` in the raw biology RDS (always present per the owner /
  verified; the one test fixture that predated them was updated).
- Provenance: `.provenance_selector` deparses any closure member (so a `keep_when`
  selector serializes as text, like the anchor's `select_event` and the channel's
  `keep_group_when`); the executor's derivation rule string records the deparsed
  predicate.

**Probe discriminator:** one Hb value, 12.5 g/dL, measured in a woman (NOT anaemic,
12.5 ≮ 12) and a man (anaemic, 12.5 < 13). A single-number cutoff cannot separate
them; only a predicate that reads `PATSEX` can -- that is the invariant the test locks.

**Open (unchanged, still deferred §16):** source-kind registry resolution (a channel
omitting `source=`) -- owner agrees it "può probabilmente continuare a marcire dov'è".

## Package-first promotion ratified; redsan typing is the prerequisite -- Claude Fable + Sol review (2026-07-12)

**Goal & acceptance criteria.** Promote the successful prototype into the internal R
package `extractionengine` without preserving the experimental API or re-running the
same architectural exploration. The package must carry every capability implemented
and ratified at `444b0cb`, leave §16-only deferrals deferred, make the authored spec the
single executable/audited definition, and pass package-native tests plus built-tarball
check. Scientific correctness remains the researcher's responsibility; the package
executes and audits the declared rule.

**Ratified direction (owner, after Codex proposal + Fable counter-review).**

- Same repository, isolated branch/worktree: `codex/package-rebuild` at
  `C:\Users\franc\Documents\Git\extraction-engine-package`. The prototype is frozen
  under annotated tag `checkpoint/pre-package-rebuild-2026-07-12`; `master` remains
  frozen until promotion. This knowingly leaves the currently identified fail-open
  authoring bugs on the prototype branch; there are no consumers, so no compatibility
  patch is required there.
- Internal, rigorously designed package named `extractionengine`; no backward
  compatibility, no CRAN/public-release contract, internal-use license. DESCRIPTION
  uses the owner's real name (not the GitHub handle) with the configured noreply email.
- `variable_template()` is removed. Reusable recipes are plain R builders/snippets
  returning `variable_spec()`. Constructors have explicit formals: an argument is read
  and validated or rejected; no open `...` bags.
- `resolve_variable_spec()` becomes the one executable representation consumed by the
  runner, `inspect()`, and provenance. This structurally removes the current
  template-`combine_at_level`, ignored-argument, and incomplete-inspection failures.
- The product thesis leads README and the concise replacement DESIGN contract:
  **the engine is the auditable executor of a study's operational definitions, not
  the author of those definitions.** The prototype DESIGN remains available through
  the tag/history rather than being carried as the new package contract.

**Amendment 1 -- redsan owns typing (prerequisite slice, owner-ratified).** The live
`redsan::edsan_sources()` registry is real and is the source of EDSAN identifiers,
grain, and point/interval time mechanics. It does not currently supply semantic payload
bindings or column types. Current `process_pmsi()` / `process_biol()` parse their date
fields but leave `PATAGE` and biology result payloads character; doceds has no processor,
so `RECDATE` is not normalized there. Today extraction-engine's `col()` layer performs
those coercions. Dropping it before moving typing upstream would make numeric predicates
silently compare strings.

Before the package source slice, a separate reviewed `redsan` slice must therefore:

- return numeric `PATAGE` in the normalized PMSI and biology tables;
- preserve the raw biology result while adding a stable numeric companion (non-numeric
  values such as inequality strings remain visible in the raw field and become missing
  in the numeric field, never silently rewritten);
- normalize doceds `RECDATE` through an explicit doceds processing path;
- protect each rule with source-/process-contract tests and pass `test_local`, build,
  and built-tarball check.

Only after that slice may `extractionengine` remove `col()`/date parsing and trust
prepared inputs. It imports `redsan (>= 0.1.0)` and uses its live registry rather than
copying source mechanics. Engine-side `source_spec()` retains only payload-role binding
and prepared-view declarations. Exact biology companion-column names and the public
doceds processor spelling must be ratified in the redsan slice before implementation;
they must not be guessed downstream.

**Amendment 2 -- the ellmer boundary is a relocation, not a replacement.** Fable's
code check corrected the premise: `make_ollama_caller()` already creates an ellmer Chat
and calls `chat_structured()`. The package rebuild moves Chat construction to the caller,
accepts the Chat directly, and deep-clones/clears it per task; it does not change the
structured-output mechanism. The text slice must retain the existing approved-model /
grammar-gate regression, record the Chat's provider/model **and params** (temperature,
seed, max tokens), and preserve partial-response/output-token/length-truncation
diagnostics inside `model_error` when the DIY retry wrapper is removed. No conversation
state may cross tasks and the supplied Chat must remain unchanged.

**Amendment 3 -- new surface is not new capability (owner ruling).** Prepared-view
`source_spec`, mandatory candidate-selection closure, direct Chat injection, and a live
redsan runtime dependency are new API/plumbing surfaces implementing responsibilities
already ratified. They do not add a new study/measurement capability, so the capability
freeze stands. Because surface mistakes caused the current fail-open bugs, each new
surface must nevertheless be listed explicitly, reviewed, and tested fail-closed.

**Amendment 4 -- differential oracle at promotion.** The prototype tag is not enough
as a prose oracle because the APIs intentionally differ. The promotion gate must execute
the same synthetic cases through the tagged prototype and the package, normalize the
public envelopes, and compare them mechanically. The minimum matrix is:

1. structured subject-context lab membership;
2. stay-level combine with key-scoped payload;
3. text categorical extraction including citation warning / invalid sibling handling;
4. document-date output with anchor/window behavior.

Compare values, membership, channel coverage/status, and resolvable evidence links; do
not compare incidental internal layouts. Any intentional behavioral difference needs an
owner-ratified DESIGN/HANDOFF decision before promotion.

**Execution/review gates.** (1) redsan typing contract; (2) package shell + concise
contract; (3) source/spec compiler; (4) structured runtime; (5) text/ellmer; (6) audit,
docs, differential runs, package build/check; (7) owner promotion. Each slice is a small
commit reviewed mutually by Claude and Codex, with disagreements and tradeoffs recorded
here. No clinical data or patient-derived artifact enters either repository.

**Files changed.** `HANDOFF.md` only. No code, tag, branch, worktree, or package files
were changed by this ratification entry.

**Open questions / uncertainties.** The product decisions are closed. The redsan slice
must still name and validate its typed biology companion columns and decide whether the
doceds normalization is exposed as `process_doceds()` or an equivalent package-owned
processor. Those are upstream interface decisions to settle before the package source
slice, not reasons to re-open the package direction.

**Execution update -- Sol (2026-07-12).** The upstream names are now resolved as
`NUMRES_NUM` (numeric companion; `NUMRES` remains unchanged) and
`process_doceds()`. The focused implementation is commit `f7ed07e` on redsan branch
`codex/extractionengine-typing`, versioned as `redsan 0.1.1`. It passes 74 local test
assertions plus source-package build and built-tarball check. Consequently the package
dependency is tightened to `redsan (>= 0.1.1)`: version 0.1.0 predates the typing
contract and cannot honestly satisfy that prerequisite.

## Package rebuild implemented; promotion awaits reciprocal review -- Sol (2026-07-12)

**Implemented state.** The package rebuild is complete on
`codex/package-rebuild`, in commits `836063b` through `f8d7d55`. The frozen
prototype remains available at `checkpoint/pre-package-rebuild-2026-07-12`.
The package now has a normal DESCRIPTION/NAMESPACE/testthat structure, concise
README and DESIGN contracts, a package-owned public API, and no exported
clinical concepts.

The transferred engine preserves the ratified grain, window, combine, payload,
coverage, evidence, and provenance semantics. `variable_template()` and the
obsolete real-run plumbing are gone. Source and variable specifications use
explicit formals, `resolve_variable_spec()` is the representation shared by
execution, inspection, and provenance, prepared EDSAN views are typed upstream,
and text execution accepts an isolated ellmer Chat while retaining the existing
grammar gate and failure diagnostics. No new warehouse, retry, runtime, typing,
or scientific-decision layer was introduced.

**Verification.** All checks used synthetic fixtures only and printed no patient
data.

- redsan `f7ed07e`: 74 assertions; source build and built-tarball check both OK;
- extractionengine: 234 assertions, 0 failures, warnings, or skips;
- temporary differential oracle: `subject_context_lab`, `stay_keyed_payload`,
  `text`, and `document_date` all compare OK for values, membership, coverage,
  status, evidence references, and the normalized public envelope;
- `R CMD build` produced `extractionengine_0.1.0.tar.gz`; built-tarball
  `R CMD check --no-manual --no-build-vignettes` finished with `Status: OK`.
  The console reported only unavailable online repository indexes in the
  restricted environment, not package warnings or notes.

**Review and promotion gate.** Sol's final code review found no implementation
blocker; it removed two stale local-context comments and the obsolete prototype
runner. A reciprocal Fable/owner review of the implemented branches has not been
performed in this session, so neither `codex/package-rebuild` nor
`codex/extractionengine-typing` has been merged or pushed. Promotion to `master`
must wait for that explicit gate.

The package worktree currently lives at
`C:\Users\franc\Documents\Git\extraction-engine\outputs\extraction-engine-package`
rather than the planned sibling path because this session could write only
inside the extraction-engine workspace. This changes no Git history and the
worktree can be moved after review. The redsan worktree is likewise isolated at
`outputs/redsan-typing`; both source branches are clean.

## Real-data correction to the NUMRES contract -- owner + Sol (2026-07-12)

The owner challenged the unverified `"<3"` test fixture behind the
`NUMRES_NUM` companion. A privacy-preserving profile then inspected only storage
types and format counts in the available D0740 biology extract and the D0840
prepared/raw biology pair; no identifiers, rows, or result values were printed
or retained.

The observed contract is simpler: prepared `NUMRES` is numeric, raw D0840
stores numeric scalars in list form, and no decimal-comma, comparator, or text
shape occurs in `NUMRES`. Qualitative results remain in `STRRES`. Running
`process_biol()` over the real D0840 raw object reproduced the prepared numeric
vector exactly, including missingness.

Consequently redsan commit `5e287e7` normalizes `NUMRES` in place and leaves
`STRRES` untouched; it removes the speculative `NUMRES_NUM` field and the
unsupported `"<3"` fixture. Package commit `51dc11d` updates only the boundary
test to consume typed `NUMRES`. No locale parser or qualified-result semantics
were added.

The corrected state passes 75 redsan assertions, 234 extractionengine
assertions, both built-tarball checks with `Status: OK`, and all four
old/new differential cases. The temporary profiling scripts were deleted. The
reciprocal-review gate before promotion remains unchanged.

## Reciprocal review closed; promotion gate passed -- Sol + independent Sol (2026-07-12)

The reciprocal review initially found execution-contract blockers rather than
scientific disagreements: the declared anchor was not consistently authoritative,
event linkage and windows could fail to compose, declared roles and output shapes
could fail open, PMSI procedure timestamps were not fully typed, and some text paths
could escape the declared cohort/event scope or expose identifiers in errors. No
clinical selector or scientific rule was added to address them.

The fixes are deliberately split into small commits:

- redsan `ab6fb02` types `DATEACTE` and `HEURE_DATEACTE` while preserving source
  columns and output shape;
- extractionengine `e5a5cb9` enforces compiled anchor, role, linkage, and provenance
  contracts;
- extractionengine `c17b69e` enforces declared categorical levels and structured
  fields;
- extractionengine `5abe857` bounds raw and pre-retrieved text execution to the
  declared cohort/event scope and redacts identifiers from errors;
- extractionengine `535381a` composes event linkage with windows, ignores incidental
  anchors, validates pre-retrieved candidates before Chat, preserves per-task
  isolation for malformed structured outputs, and validates `summary_required`.

Final verification used only synthetic fixtures and fake Chats:

- redsan: 77 assertions; `R CMD build` and built-tarball `R CMD check` finish with
  `Status: OK`;
- extractionengine: 275 assertions, 0 failures, warnings, or skips; `R CMD build`
  and built-tarball `R CMD check` finish with `Status: OK`;
- the temporary old/new oracle reports `OK` for `subject_context_lab`,
  `stay_keyed_payload`, `text`, and `document_date`;
- `git diff --check` is clean for both branches.

The same independent reviewer then reran the original and residual repro matrix,
the complete suites, and an offline package check. It found no P1 or P2 in scope and
declared no blocker to promotion for extractionengine `535381a` or redsan `ab6fb02`.
The pre-existing experimental API residue was unchanged and was judged non-blocking;
cleaning it remains outside this migration. No patient data, real model call, network
download, clinical concept, or scientific correctness judgment entered the work.

## Relational concept -> activation -> output contract -- superseded WIP (2026-07-18)

The July 14 lane-typing direction was superseded before release. At this
intermediate stage, the breaking API separated three responsibilities:
`concept_spec()` locates source rows, mandatory `use_channel(channel =)` defines
their variable-local use, and `from_channel()` selects the exact prepared-source
column and optional reducer.
`analyte()` now selects only `TYPEANA`; typed analyte selectors, inferred result
lanes, the dual-lane error, legacy output constructors, and implicit payload
routing are removed. A biology row may retain `NUMRES`, `STRRES`, and `DATEXAM` together;
the explicit output column makes the read unambiguous.

Activation aliases are first-class audit coordinates. `filter_rows`, `group_by`,
and `filter_groups` are variable-local row/group operations. A relative `window`
also belongs to the activation while `anchor` remains the shared task clock. Text
retrieval declares `search_within`, independently of `combine_by`, output
`restrict_to_combined_by`, and `output_one_row_per`.

The combine is a qualifying relation keyed by `combine_by`: a finer relation is
projected existentially, the same key matches directly, and a coarser relation is
broadcast explicitly to output units. A payload restriction is a `semi_join()`
on either the combine key or the output key and is mandatory when those keys
differ; it never creates an intermediate aggregation. Native evidence stay
identity is preserved as `source_EVTID` when public `EVTID` denotes a different
target stay. An LLM response is one row per output task, so cross-grain LLM
payloads currently support only output-key restriction; lower-key restriction
would require per-key calls.

LLM activations accept a native `ellmer::TypeObject`. Field-specific instructions
live in its descriptions; the engine owns the general system prompt, target and
excerpt user message, dynamic evidence enum, and optional rationale field.
Omitted/`TRUE` rationale uses the generic description, a string overrides it, and
`FALSE`/`NULL` disables it. `chat_structured()` remains the structured-output
boundary and a whole response frame is published by `from_channel(alias)`.

This entry records an intermediate contract and supersedes only the July 14 WIP
entry above it in history. It is itself superseded by the July 19 consolidation
below; removed names in this section are historical, not current authoring syntax.

**Implementation and verification.** The dirty WIP was consolidated in place;
no reset, compatibility shim, commit, or merge was performed. The suite contains
exactly three sentinel `test_that()` blocks and finishes with 28 assertions, zero
failures, warnings, or skips. `R CMD build` produced
`extractionengine_0.1.0.tar.gz`; the built-tarball
`R CMD check --no-manual` finished with `Status: OK`, and `git diff --check` is
clean. The unrestricted manual-PDF check reached the documentation and test gates
but could not run `pdflatex`, which is not installed on this machine.

That verified tarball was installed in the local R 4.5 library. The Desktop demo
then loaded the installed package and completed its deterministic path for three
stays with `options(extractionengine.demo_llm = FALSE)`. The real Ollama call
remains intentionally disabled pending the owner's interactive validation.

## Activation-owned models and compact audit envelope -- superseded WIP (2026-07-18)

The ongoing dirty-WIP cleanup moves `model` and `model_params` from
`variable_spec()` to each `lucene_llm` `use_channel()`. This makes model choice
part of the activation's LLM configuration and permits different activations in
one variable to use different transports. `run_variable(chat =)` remains a
single global test/debug override; task calls still use isolated Chat clones.

The public run envelope is now limited to `values`, `channel_status`, `evidence`,
and `audit`. Evidence exposes one canonical `evidence_ref`, optional
prompt-local `snippet_id`, and publishes any native evidence `EVTID` as
`source_EVTID`; it can equal the target under event-scoped retrieval. Internal
`source_row_id` and `hit_ref` remain in `audit$internal$channel_intermediates`.
Audit metadata is nested: long staged
`counts`, `llm_calls`, the resolved `execution_manifest`, and, for combines,
`overlap` and `combine_keys`. The executable `resolved_spec` and raw
`channel_intermediates` are explicitly separated under `audit$internal`.

This slice retains exactly three sentinel `test_that()` blocks (45 expectations).
`testthat::test_local(".")`, `R CMD build`, the built-tarball
`R CMD check --no-manual` (`Status: OK`), and `git diff --check` all pass. The
verified tarball is installed in the local R 4.5 library; the Desktop demo loads
that installation and completes its deterministic path for three stays with the
LLM disabled. The real Ollama call remains for the owner's interactive check.
No compatibility shim, commit, or merge is part of this WIP.

## Self-contained combine, output grain, and canonical naming -- superseded by the data-mask tranche (2026-07-19)

The approved final consolidation replaces the separate
`combine_channels`/`combine_by` and `output_one_row_per` axes with two complete
contracts. `variable_spec(name, concept, anchor, channels, combine, output)` now
receives `combine = combine_channels(expr, by)`, while `bin_output(group_by)` or
`from_channel(channel, column, filter_by_qualified, group_by, reduce)` owns the
final output grain. `name` remains the explicit canonical variable identifier;
there is no PATID default and no compatibility shim for the removed signatures.
The public hit-set authoring surface is the single boolean expression string in
`combine_channels()`; `hit_set_expr()`, `any_positive()`, and
`hit_set_difference()` are no longer exported.

Cross-grain payload execution is now explicit and ordered:
`combine by -> filter by qualified -> group by -> reduce`.
`filter_by_qualified` is admitted and required only when the combine grain is
finer than the output grain. It can retain either rows of qualifying subunits
(`combine$by`) or all rows of qualified final units (`output$group_by`); it must
be `NULL` without a combine, at equal grain, and for coarse-to-fine broadcast.
The reducer then receives non-missing raw values once per final group, without
implicit intermediate aggregation. An LLM payload in this fine-to-coarse case
supports only output-grain filtering and still forbids `reduce`.

`use_channel(group_by =)` remains deliberately different: it is only the
intermediate grouping paired with `filter_groups`, never the published grain.
`inspect()` and the execution manifest expose the combine, qualified-row filter,
terminal grouping, and reducer as distinct stages. `audit$combine_keys` retains
the qualifying relation at `combine$by`.

`run_protocol()` accepts an entirely unnamed list or an entirely named list whose
names exactly match each `spec$name` in order. Duplicate canonical names,
partially named lists, and discordant external names fail; returned results are
always named from `spec$name`, so call sites no longer repeat `var = var`.

All README, design-contract, reference-manual, and Desktop-demo examples use only
this new surface. The README includes the equivalent relational data flow:
`semi_join() -> group_by() -> summarise()`. Vignette infrastructure remains a
later tranche.

Final verification retains exactly three sentinel `test_that()` blocks with 49
passing expectations. `testthat::test_local(".")`, `R CMD build`, the built-tarball
`R CMD check --no-manual` (`Status: OK`), and `git diff --check` all pass. The
unrestricted manual-PDF check reaches all code, documentation, and test gates but
cannot create the PDF because `pdflatex` is unavailable on this machine. The
verified tarball is installed in the local R 4.5 library; the deterministic
Desktop demo completes for three stays with the LLM disabled, and the owner has
subsequently inspected and validated the interactive demo results. The
consolidation is recorded as one direct commit on `master`; no PR or merge is
required.

### Deferred: lazy execution of payload-only LLM activations

Today every activation is executed for every output task before the combine is
evaluated. Consequently, an LLM activation used only by `from_channel()` can be
called even for units later excluded by the combine; its authored fields are then
masked to `NA`, while the call and its evidence remain observable in the audit.

A future tranche should split qualification from payload execution: run the
channels referenced by `combine_channels()` first, derive the qualified output
tasks, and invoke a payload-only LLM activation only for those tasks. It must also
define an explicit audit state for payload calls skipped by the gate and ensure
that their nonexistent evidence is not confused with retrieval failure. Preserve
the current published-value semantics and cover the change inside the existing
LLM sentinel rather than adding another `test_that()` block.

## Relational evidence and LLM grounding regressions repaired -- Codex (2026-07-21)

This bounded correctness tranche repairs three review findings without changing
the public API. Text retrieval now deduplicates normalized hit sentences only
within the same native `EVTID`/`ELTID` identity, so identical wording in distinct
documents cannot erase stay/document membership before relational combination.
The LLM candidate view separately deduplicates normalized hit text per task
before applying `max_candidates`, preserving prompt diversity without changing
the retrieval relation.
A completed LLM response is valid only when at least one citation resolves to a
supplied snippet: mixed real/invented citations remain grounded and flagged,
whereas invented-only and uncited responses publish typed missing fields with an
invalid/review state while retaining the raw response in audit. Finally, public
evidence for a gated deterministic payload is restricted to the same qualifying
row relation as its value calculation; the full pre-gate intermediate remains in
`audit$internal`.

The existing three sentinel `test_that()` blocks now contain 70 passing
expectations. `testthat::test_local(".")`, source-package build, built-tarball
`R CMD check --no-manual --no-build-vignettes` (`Status: OK`), and
`git diff --check` pass. Repository-index warnings during check reflect the
restricted network and did not produce a package warning or note.

The medium-priority validation and housekeeping findings remain a separate
reviewable tranche: contradictory pre-retrieved text states, unconstrained
`index_event(select_event =)`, and historical handoff cleanup.

## Medium input boundaries and protected test floor -- Codex (2026-07-21)

The remaining medium findings are closed at their existing ownership boundaries.
Pre-retrieved text validation now accepts only the three states produced by real
retrieval and requires the task sets on the two sides of the relation to agree:
candidate rows exist if and only if `coverage_state == "candidate"`. This prevents
the previously accepted public contradiction `value = 0` plus positive evidence.
`index_event(select_event =)` is now selection-only: every returned composite
`EVTID`/date tuple must already occur in that patient's matched event relation.
Filtering, reordering, valid multi-row event emission, and Date/POSIXct inputs
remain supported; crossed or fabricated tuples fail before channel execution.

The test suite was then reviewed assertion by assertion using the established
gate: keep a test only when it protects an engine invariant, an external/source
contract, or a known silent regression we would intentionally defend today.
The three sentinel blocks fell from 70 to 30 expectations. Removed checks were
mainly exact stage counts, `formals()` introspection, deterministic naming and
toggle behavior, wording snapshots, duplicate class/value checks, and internal
layout assertions. Retained checks cover explicit source-column semantics,
fail-closed cardinality, cross-grain row qualification and broadcast, truthful
evidence/provenance, native text identity, no-candidate call skipping, bounded
prompt diversity, citation grounding, and the two repaired trust boundaries.
Each retained assertion cluster now states the invariant it protects, and exact
row comparisons canonicalize order rather than making incidental execution order
part of the contract.

The collaboration header is model-agnostic again; it no longer goes stale when a
named assistant or model version changes. No unexpected worktree artifacts were
created. `testthat::test_local(".")` passes all 30 expectations; source-package
build and built-tarball `R CMD check --no-manual --no-build-vignettes` finish with
`Status: OK`; `git diff --check` passes. Repository-index warnings reflect the
restricted network and did not produce a package warning or note. No commit was
created.

## First deterministic onboarding vignette -- Codex (2026-07-22)

The vignette tranche deferred after the Desktop-demo validation is now
implemented as `vignettes/getting-started.Rmd`. It is a standalone synthetic
ionic-balance example rather than a copy of the real-data demo. Its progressive
path covers concept/channel naming, a simple deterministic output, boolean
qualification, the cross-grain `filter_by_qualified` distinction, the equivalent
`semi_join() -> group_by() -> summarise()` flow, and guided reading of `values`,
`channel_status`, `evidence`, `execution_manifest`, `combine_keys`, and `counts`.
The README links it as the first user onboarding entry point.

The vignette deliberately excludes external data and model calls. LLM authoring
remains linked from the README, and lazy execution of payload-only LLM
activations remains a separate runtime tranche. `knitr` and `rmarkdown` are
Suggests-only dependencies; `VignetteBuilder: knitr` makes the HTML vignette part
of the ordinary source-package build. Two fresh renders are byte-identical after
omitting only the manifest's execution timestamp from rendered output.

Verification uses the Positron-bundled Pandoc 3.8.3 with R 4.5.2. All 30 existing
test expectations pass; `R CMD build` creates the vignette; built-tarball
`R CMD check --no-manual` checks and rebuilds it with `Status: OK`; and
`git diff --check` passes. No runtime API or sentinel test changed. No commit was
created.

## Approved next-work backlog (2026-07-22)

Status update: the data-mask contract, source-local identity contract, public
result-envelope review, and focused LLM vignette are complete in the
implementation sections below. The remaining backlog starts with lazy execution
of payload-only LLM channels, then the advanced vignette and optional editor
snippets. Historical API shapes below are retained as a chronological record.

The owner approved two independent contract tranches discovered while exercising
the onboarding vignette:

1. **One dplyr-style evaluation model.** Stress-test and then implement a
   coordinated data-masked surface for row/group filters and deterministic
   output, rather than adding a convenience syntax to `filter_rows` alone. The
   target authoring shape should make direct expressions, multiple aligned source
   columns, `case_when()`, weighted summaries, and value-at-latest-date operations
   natural while still producing one cell per output task. Before coding, fix the
   zero-row, missing-value, `.data`/`.env`, programmatic-authoring, audit-printing,
   and size-one rules.
2. **Source-local element identity.** For biology, `ELTID` and `BIOL_ID` are
   unique one-to-one identifiers of the same exam. `ELTID` is the engine's generic
   source-item coordinate; `BIOL_ID` is the native alias and should be preserved
   when available, not required for execution. Correct the canonical casing to
   `BIOL_ID`. `ELTID` values cannot join different sources: compiling
   `combine_channels(..., by = "ELTID")` should accept distinct selectors or
   activation aliases only when they resolve to the same source identity domain,
   and reject cross-source combinations.

After those public contracts settle, review the result envelope before teaching
it more broadly:

- make `results$x$evidence` easy to interpret without redundant identifiers while
  preserving resolvable source provenance;
- clarify `results$x$channel_status`, especially the meanings of execution state,
  candidate availability, hit/signal, and contribution;
- simplify and document `results$x$audit`, retaining the useful `counts`,
  `overlap`, and `combine_keys` relations while making the execution manifest,
  LLM-call table, and internal trace less ambiguous;
- complete the already deferred lazy execution of payload-only LLM activations,
  including an explicit skipped-by-gate audit state.

Documentation then proceeds in three layers rather than copying the Desktop demo:

1. enrich and revise `getting-started` against the settled deterministic API and
   public result envelope;
2. add a focused LLM vignette covering TypeObject authoring, retrieval scope,
   rationale/evidence grounding, failures, and audit;
3. add an advanced vignette for cross-grain qualification, same-source
   `ELTID` query composition, multi-column deterministic calculations, and other
   deliberately non-cosmetic combinations.

Authoring ergonomics is a separate, small backlog item: provide tab-stop
boilerplate snippets for `concept_spec()` and `variable_spec()`. Snippets belong
to the editor rather than the R runtime, so investigate shipping canonical
templates with explicit opt-in setup for both Positron/VS Code TextMate snippets
and RStudio `r.snippets`. Package installation must not silently rewrite a
user's IDE configuration.

## Data-mask and source-local identity tranche implemented (2026-07-22)

The first backlog item now supersedes the earlier function-formal and
single-column output surface. `use_channel()` captures `filter_rows` and
`filter_groups` as data-masked expressions. They see complete aligned source
columns plus their lexical environment, including `.data`, `.env`, and tidy
injection. Row filters return one logical per row (`NA` is false); grouped
filters return one non-missing logical per activation-local group.

The deterministic output contract is now:

```r
from_channel(
    channel,
    group_by,
    value = <data-masked expression>,
    filter_by_qualified = NULL
)
```

`column` and `reduce` were removed without compatibility shims. `value` is
evaluated once on each final task's complete, row-aligned payload and may use
several prepared-source columns. It owns missing-value handling and must produce
one atomic scalar or one list cell. With no payload rows the engine does not
evaluate author code and publishes logical `NA`. An LLM output omits `value` and
continues to publish its whole structured response record. `audit$counts` now
labels `output_input` in `source_row` units.

The biology source retains `source_result_id = "BIOL_ID"` with canonical casing,
but requires only the generic execution fields including `ELTID`; `BIOL_ID` is
preserved when supplied and is not mandatory. Because `ELTID` is source-local,
resolution rejects `combine_channels(..., by = "ELTID")` across source identity
domains. It also rejects applying qualified `ELTID` keys to a payload from a
different source; projecting qualification first to `EVTID` or `PATID` remains
valid.

The three sentinel tests were migrated in place, without adding a fourth
`test_that()`. They cover direct expressions, `.data`/`.env`, multi-column
weighted and latest-row calculations, `case_when()`, empty/cardinality behavior,
optional native biology identity, same-source document composition, and both
cross-source `ELTID` failure modes. README, DESIGN, Rd, and the onboarding
vignette use the same contract. `testthat::test_local(".")` under R 4.6.1 passes
all 33 expectations; its five warnings are the already-known Ellmer 0.5
deprecation of `.additional_properties`. R 4.5.2 plus the Positron Pandoc builds
the vignette and source tarball, and `R CMD check --no-manual` on that tarball
finishes with `Status: OK`. The R 4.6.1 library does not currently contain
`knitr`, so it was not used as the vignette builder. `git diff --check` passes
with only the checkout's LF-to-CRLF notices. The verified tarball was installed
into the local R 4.6 library; an installed-package smoke confirms the new
formals, direct data-mask execution without `BIOL_ID`, and the packaged vignette.
No commit was created.

## Public result-envelope contract consolidated (2026-07-22)

The result-envelope review replaces the overlapping public channel state fields
with two explicit axes. `channel_status` keeps the output keys, canonical
variable, activation alias, and logical source. `selection_status` is exactly
`matched`, `no_match`, or `unavailable`. `processing_status` is `not_required`
for non-LLM channels; for `lucene_llm` it is exactly `completed`, `not_called`,
`invalid`, or `failed`. These values describe mechanical execution and do not
encode a clinical interpretation.

Public evidence now declares why each row is present through `evidence_kind`:
`source_row`, `lucene_hit`, or `llm_citation`. `evidence_ref` is an opaque,
non-missing coordinate local to the executed run and source snapshot, not a
globally durable warehouse identifier. Native source identity remains visible,
including `source_EVTID`; it remains distinct from a target `EVTID` even when the
values coincide. Private `source_row_id` and `hit_ref` coordinates remain under
`audit$internal`.

`audit$counts` uses one stage vocabulary across executors: `pre_selector`,
`window`, `selector`, `filtered_selector`, `model_input`, and `output_input`.
These stages count associated rows, window survivors, selector matches,
post-activation-filter matches, model snippets, and terminal value-input rows,
respectively. README, DESIGN, the reference manual, and the onboarding vignette
describe this same public contract. Lazy execution of payload-only LLM channels
remains the separate deferred tranche recorded above.

`audit$llm_calls` now has a stable empty schema, drops the duplicated
`definition`, and names its independent facts `call_status`, `response_status`,
`task_validity`, and `transport_attempts`. `audit$overlap` no longer carries
accidental `names` attributes on its public columns.

## Documentation, vignette, and Desktop demo realigned (2026-07-22)

The current README, DESIGN, and Rd reference already use the data-mask/value
surface and the consolidated result envelope. The onboarding vignette now uses
the same count-stage units for structured rows, searchable documents, and
snippets. Earlier `column`/`reduce` material in this handoff is explicitly marked
as historical rather than silently rewritten.

The canonical `C:\Users\franc\Desktop\demo extractionengine.R` now uses direct
data-masked `filter_rows`/`filter_groups` expressions and
`from_channel(channel, group_by, value, filter_by_qualified)`. Its comments refer
to the terminal value expression rather than a reducer, its embedded checks cover
the public status, evidence, count-stage, and LLM-call schemas, and the Ollama
path is opt-in through `options(extractionengine.demo_llm = TRUE)`.

The deterministic demo completes eight variables for three stays under R 4.6.1.
The three sentinel tests pass all 44 expectations; the five warnings remain the
known Ellmer `.additional_properties` deprecation. The source tarball rebuilds
the vignette and `R CMD check --no-manual` ends with `Status: OK`. The tarball is
installed in the local R 4.6 library and its packaged vignette was verified.
No commit was created.

## Focused LLM vignette implemented (2026-07-22)

`vignettes/structured-text-with-llm.Rmd` is now the package onboarding path for
structured text extraction. It uses a synthetic medication-allergy question,
first validates the Lucene boundary with a deterministic `method = "lucene"`
run, then teaches native Ellmer TypeObject authoring, `search_within`, activation-
local model configuration, whole-record `from_channel()` publication, rationale,
dynamic evidence grounding, status axes, and the public LLM audit tables.

The vignette does not copy the Desktop tabagisme workflow, expose pre-retrieved
fixtures or mocks, put an LLM inside a combine, or teach `audit$internal`. Corpus,
retrieval, schema, and specification chunks execute during the build. The real
Ollama call and result-reading chunks are deliberately non-evaluated, so package
builds remain deterministic and network/model independent. README and the end of
`getting-started` link to the new vignette; both vignettes share the existing
light/dark CSS.

Verification: source-backed rendering succeeds; the three sentinel tests pass
44 expectations with only the five known Ellmer 0.5 `.additional_properties`
warnings; `R CMD build` includes both vignettes; built-tarball
`R CMD check --no-manual` finishes with `Status: OK`. The verified tarball is
installed in the local R 4.6 library, where `tools::pkgVignettes()` lists
`getting-started` and `structured-text-with-llm` and the new HTML file is present.
No real model call, commit, or merge was performed.

## Question-first audit design spike -- proposed, not implemented (2026-07-23)

The current result envelope was exercised on three concrete workflows before
renaming or extending it:

1. one lab activation reduced at `EVTID`;
2. a combine evaluated at `EVTID`, with payload and output at `PATID`;
3. Lucene retrieval followed by one structured LLM record at `EVTID`.

The exercise confirms that counts are useful summaries, but cannot be the
primary truth for all audit questions. Two patients can have identical per-channel
counts while the signals coexist in the same stay for one patient and in
different stays for the other. Likewise, the same qualifying relation can feed
different payload rows under `filter_by_qualified = "EVTID"` and `"PATID"`.
For LLM extraction, equal prompt counts do not prove that the same snippets, in
the same order, were shown or cited.

The proposed model therefore separates five relations or records:

| Proposed view | Grain | Question answered |
|---|---|---|
| `activation_counts` | output task x activation x step x unit | How many source items survived each activation boundary? |
| `combine_evaluation` | output task x declared combine key | Which channel memberships coexisted, and did that key qualify? |
| `source_usage` | output task x activation x source occurrence x context | Which concrete source items were selected and how were they used? |
| `llm_calls` | one row per real invocation | What happened at transport, structured-response, and grounding boundaries? |
| `execution_manifest` | one record per variable execution | Which resolved definition and configuration were executed? |

`values` remains the ordinary published result and is not an audit relation.
`channel_status`, coverage summaries, `overlap`, and a reader-facing `evidence`
table remain useful, but should be derivable conveniences rather than competing
sources of truth.

`activation_counts` should retain an explicit `unit`, because text retrieval
changes from documents to snippets. Its steps should use observable boundaries,
for example `source_input`, `after_window`, `after_selector`, `after_filters`,
`model_input`, and `value_input`. A zero count means that a completed step
produced an empty relation; an unexecuted or failed step must not be encoded as
zero. This view is a census, not a row-level trace.

`combine_evaluation` is the clearer long-term meaning of the current
`combine_keys`. It must retain the per-channel membership vector and the final
decision at `combine$by`; payload-only activations do not belong in that vector.
The desired relation includes the complete evaluable combine-key universe, not
only keys with at least one observed hit, so that an absent row cannot ambiguously
mean all-false, unavailable, failed, or outside the universe. This matters in
particular for negation and is not yet how the fine-to-coarse executor behaves.

`source_usage` makes row identity and execution role inspectable without calling
every selected row evidence. Its minimum roles are:

- selected by the activation;
- used to construct a channel membership for the combine;
- passed to the terminal deterministic value expression;
- sent to the LLM, with prompt position;
- cited by the accepted LLM response.

The same occurrence may have several roles. The activation alias is part of the
key, so reuse of one source row through two aliases is intentional rather than a
duplicate. A reader-facing `evidence` view can then select occurrences used by
the combine or value, plus grounded LLM citations. Uncited prompt snippets remain
auditable in `source_usage` without being mislabeled as evidence.

Applied to the observed workflows:

- lab to `EVTID`: selected rows, value-input rows, and evidence happen to
  coincide, but no combine relation exists;
- combine `EVTID` to output `PATID`: gate rows explain channel membership,
  `combine_evaluation` preserves stay-level coexistence, and payload rows explain
  the patient value; these are different relations;
- Lucene plus LLM: cited evidence is a subset of ordered model input, which is a
  subset of selected hits. A successful transport can still yield an invalid
  structured or ungrounded result.

Two implementation decisions remain deliberately open:

1. whether `source_usage` stores one row with role flags or one row per
   occurrence-role relation;
2. whether bounded/deduplicated prompt items always point to one selected source
   occurrence, or require a separate many-to-many prompt-item relation.

No runtime, public API, documentation surface, or sentinel test was changed by
this spike. The next step is owner review of these boundaries, followed by one
small vertical implementation slice rather than a wholesale audit rewrite.

## Baseline checkpoint and data-mask boundary hardening (2026-07-23)

The previously validated data-mask, source-identity, result-envelope, and two-
vignette WIP was committed and pushed directly to `master` as `3b47d7b`
(`Consolidate package contracts and onboarding`). Both vignette sources and their
shared CSS are versioned; no real clinical data or model call entered the commit.

A subsequent bounded hardening slice closes two review findings without changing
the authored API. Activation filters and deterministic output expressions now see
only prepared-source columns, never `task_id`, demotion flags, or `.ee_*` runtime
plumbing. Data-mask column references are validated before row selection, so a
misspelled or internal column fails even when the selector produces zero target
rows. The Ellmer TypeObject rebuild also relies on the closed-object default
instead of passing the deprecated `.additional_properties` argument.

The first sentinel gained two assertions for these boundaries rather than a new
`test_that()`. The three sentinels pass 46 expectations with no warning. Both
vignettes rebuild, and built-tarball `R CMD check --no-manual` finishes with
`Status: OK`. This hardening was committed and pushed as `9083da1`
(`Harden data-mask boundaries`).

One provenance limitation remains assigned to the audit tranche: the execution
manifest records a data-masked expression such as
`NUMRES < .env$threshold`, but does not yet snapshot the captured value of
`threshold`. Runtime evaluation is correct; the manifest is not yet a complete
serialization of the quosure environment.

## Activation-local concepts (2026-07-23)

The variable-level concept proved to be the wrong ownership boundary: combining
potassium and sodium otherwise required an artificial composite concept for
every research question. The breaking authoring contract is now:

```r
variable_spec(
    name = "ionic_alert",
    channels = list(
        potassium_high = use_channel(
            channel = "lab", concept = potassium,
            filter_rows = NUMRES > 5.2),
        sodium_low = use_channel(
            channel = "lab", concept = sodium,
            filter_rows = NUMRES < 135)
    ),
    combine = combine_channels(
        "potassium_high & sodium_low", by = "EVTID"),
    output = bin_output(group_by = "EVTID")
)
```

`variable_spec()` no longer has `concept=`. A character `channel=` requires an
explicit `concept_spec()` in the same `use_channel()`; an inline channel requires
`concept = NULL`. Two concepts may export the same local channel name because
combine, output, evidence, and audit continue to use activation aliases.

The compiled channel and execution manifest preserve `origin_concept`,
`origin_channel`, `origin_kind`, and `source`. ELTID safety remains source-based:
different concepts on the same source identity domain may combine at ELTID, but
different sources may not. The three sentinels include the same-channel-name
cross-concept case and verify its resolved manifest origin without adding a
fourth `test_that()`.

The three sentinels now contain 47 expectations with no warning. Both vignettes
rebuild from the source tarball, and `R CMD check --no-manual` finishes with
`Status: OK`. The PDF-manual-only gate is unavailable on this machine because
`pdflatex` is not installed.

## Phase 0 synthetic differential oracle (2026-08-21)

**Goal and acceptance criteria.** Establish a data-free before/after comparator
before changing execution semantics. A missing declared envelope column must
fail, the baseline must come from the actual base checkout, and a deliberately
changed public value must make the comparison fail.

**Change and reasoning.** `tools/differential-oracle/` now owns one snapshot
runner, a fail-fast public-envelope normalizer, a comparator, and four small
synthetic cases: structured laboratory output with a no-payload task, a
same-source `ELTID` combine, fake-LLM text extraction, and a windowed document
date. The biology fixtures preserve canonical `PATID`/`EVTID`/`ELTID`; repeated
rows may share one biology `ELTID`, while the combine never crosses sources.
`channel_coverage` and audit internals are deliberately outside the baseline.

The no-payload acceptance criterion was corrected while implementing it:
`n_payload_rows` is removed before public return, so the oracle pins the retained
task row, missing value, and public selection/processing states instead of an
internal field.

**Verification.** A detached worktree at `f2ba3bb` produced the ignored baseline;
the current working tree matches it in all four cases. The normalizer rejects a
missing declared column, and a snapshot with one altered value makes the
comparator exit 1. `testthat::test_local(".")` passes. `R CMD build` passes;
`R CMD check --no-manual --no-build-vignettes` validates installation, code,
documentation, and tests, with only the two expected missing-vignette-output
warnings caused by deliberately skipping vignette builds.

**Files changed.** `tools/differential-oracle/*`, `DESCRIPTION`, `PLAN.md`, and
this handoff entry. The generated `.rds` snapshots remain ignored under
`outputs/differential-oracle/`; no patient-derived artifact is a baseline.

**Open.** Promotion to a permanent test or CI remains deferred until the rewrite
shows that this exact envelope still protects a useful contract. No engine
runtime or public API changed in Phase 0.

## Phase 1.1 task assembly (2026-08-22)

**Goal and invariant.** Remove the per-task rescans and one-row tibble
allocations from result assembly without changing observable behavior. Executor
`coverage` and `values` must contain at most one row per `task_id`; duplicate
rows now fail instead of being reduced by silently taking the first match.

**Change and reasoning.** `.reduce_channel_result()` now returns one ordered
`task_id`/`status`/`hit` table. Evidence was removed from that reducer because no
consumer read it; public evidence continues to come directly from the executor
result. Membership values and public channel statuses are assembled as complete
vectors. Deterministic `from_channel()` payload is partitioned once with task
IDs as declared factor levels, so zero-row tasks remain present; the authored
value expression is still evaluated exactly once per task. The gated payload
path uses the same partition, and LLM assembly indexes its one-row-per-task
views once rather than rescanning them.

**Verification.** The Phase 0 oracle is unchanged across structured empty-task,
same-source `ELTID` combine, fake-LLM text, and document-date cases. The three
current-contract sentinels pass. Direct probes confirm that duplicate coverage
and duplicate values both fail on the new invariant. On R 4.5.2, the same
500-task/2,500-payload-row numeric `from_channel()` run fell from 2.280 s to
0.500 s (4.6x) in one before/after measurement; returned size remained 3.321 MB.
The timing is evidence that the intended cost was removed, not a performance
contract. `R CMD build` passes. `R CMD check --no-manual
--no-build-vignettes` validates installation, code, documentation, and tests;
its only two warnings are the expected missing built-vignette outputs caused by
that option, while both vignette source files execute successfully.

**Files changed.** `R/channel-combine.R`, `R/run_variable.R`, and this entry. No
executor, authoring API, public schema, or clinical rule changed.

## Phase 1.5 redundant evidence assertion (2026-08-22)

**Decision.** Delete `.assert_evidence_resolves()` and its three calls from the
structured executors. This removes a repeated quadratic scan, not an evidence
contract.

**Why the check was tautological.** `.validate_structured_inputs()` already
requires unique `task_id` and `source_row_id`. Each `observations` relation is an
inner join of those task and source rows; the row/group predicates only mutate
and demote existing rows. Each `evidence` relation is then a filtered projection
of `observations`. Consequently every evidence `(task_id, source_row_id)` pair is
unique, exists once in observations, and its `source_row_id` exists once in the
prepared source by construction. The deleted function had no independent
failure state.

**Verification.** There are no live references to the function or its three
error messages. The Phase 0 oracle is unchanged in all four cases and the three
current-contract sentinels pass. On R 4.5.2, one 1,000-task/5,000-payload-row
numeric `from_channel()` run fell from 0.780 s to 0.500 s (1.6x total-run
speedup); the timing is supporting evidence, not a contract. `R CMD build`
passes. `R CMD check --no-manual --no-build-vignettes` validates installation,
code, documentation, and tests; its only two warnings are the expected missing
built-vignette outputs, while both vignette source files execute successfully.

**Files changed.** `R/structured.R` and this entry. No public or private result
field, executor input, or authoring API changed.

## Phase 1.6 dead declarative surface (2026-08-22)

**Decision.** Delete `native_grain`, `produces`, `act_channel()`, and the
structured-executor `derivation` tables. These are four removals, not one new
abstraction. `native_grain` and `act_channel()` are intentional authoring-API
breaks; no compatibility shim was added.

**Why each removal is earned.** `native_grain` was validated, copied through
`inspect()` and resolution, and never used to decide scope or output grain.
`produces` was derived from the channel type, copied into the resolved spec, and
never read. `act_channel()` had no repository caller; its `"act"` dispatch was
identical to `"code"` and became unreachable with the constructor gone. CCAM
remains explicit through `ccam()` inside `code_channel()`; the registered coded
source continues to own the physical code/date binding. Finally, `derivation`
was constructed independently by the three structured executors and then copied
mechanically into `audit$internal$channel_intermediates`; no code, test, or live
documentation read it.

**Change.** Channel constructors no longer accept or store `native_grain`, and
resolved/inspection objects no longer carry it or `produces`. The exported
`act_channel()` wrapper, its now-unreachable type branch, its `NAMESPACE` entry,
and its help alias were removed. Structured code, document, and laboratory
executors no longer allocate their unused `derivation` frames. `man/channels.Rd`
now matches the reduced signatures.

**Verification.** Static whole-repository search found no live callers or
consumers. The Phase 0 oracle is unchanged in all four cases and all 46
current-contract expectations pass. A synthetic CCAM run through
`code_channel("pmsi_actes", ccam(...))` produced `value = 1`; its resolved channel
has type `"code"`, and its internal objects contain none of `native_grain`,
`produces`, or `derivation`. `R CMD build` passes. `R CMD check --no-manual
--no-build-vignettes` validates installation, code, documentation, and tests;
its only two warnings are the expected missing built-vignette outputs caused by
that option, while both vignette source files execute successfully.

**Files changed.** `R/channels.R`, `R/spec.R`, `R/run_variable.R`,
`R/structured.R`, `NAMESPACE`, `man/channels.Rd`, and this entry. Public
`values`, `channel_status`, and `evidence` did not change.

## Phase 1.7 internal source registry (2026-08-22)

**Decision.** De-export `source_spec()`, `source_roles()`,
`validate_source_view()`, and `edsan_source_specs()`. The first three remain
internal implementation functions; the last was an unused public getter for
the private `EE_SOURCES` registry.

**Why.** Public execution accepts only registered, prepared EDSAN sources. A
caller-created source specification could be constructed and validated but
could not be registered with or executed by `.run_selected_channel()`. Keeping
the constructors public therefore advertised an authoring path the engine did
not support. Static searches found no external caller or import in the local
Git and Desktop project roots.

**Change.** Remove the four `NAMESPACE` exports and their shared help page.
Source registration, role lookup, and prepared-view validation stay in
`R/data.R`, where the execution kernel still uses them.

**Verification.** Namespace probes confirm that all four names remain internal
and none is exported; `EE_SOURCES` still contains the four registered sources.
The Phase 0 oracle is unchanged in all four cases and all 46 current-contract
expectations pass. `R CMD build` passes. `R CMD check --no-manual
--no-build-vignettes` validates installation, code, documentation, and tests;
its only two warnings are the expected missing built-vignette outputs, while
both vignette source files execute successfully.

**Files changed.** `NAMESPACE`, `man/source_spec.Rd`, and this entry. No source
contract, prepared data, or execution result changed. The public API
intentionally shrank by these four unusable entries.

## Phase 1.8 cohort-keyed source preparation (2026-08-22)

**Decision.** A prepared source bundle may be reused only for the same set of
valid PATIDs. Order, duplicate PATIDs, and finer cohort columns do not affect
source preparation, so the canonical cache key is the sorted unique PATID set.

**Why mismatch is an error.** Preparation restricts source rows to that PATID
set before normalization. A bundle prepared for another cohort has already
lost rows and cannot be repaired from itself; callers must pass the original
unprepared sources instead of receiving a silently stale subset.

**Change.** `.prepare_execution_sources()` records the key in the internal
`ee_prepared_patids` attribute. A marked bundle passes through on an identical
key and fails clearly on a different key.

**Verification.** A focused two-patient probe reproduced the old stale reuse,
then confirmed same-cohort reuse, rejection of cross-cohort reuse, and correct
preparation of the second cohort from the original sources. All 46
current-contract expectations pass, and the Phase 0 oracle is unchanged in all
four cases.

**Files changed.** `R/data.R` and this entry. Public results and authoring APIs
are unchanged.

## Phase 1.9 cross-source ELTID rationale (2026-08-22)

**Decision.** Keep `combine_channels(..., by = "ELTID")` valid for aliases of
one source and reject it across sources. The validation behavior is unchanged.

**Correct rationale.** `by` names the unit where the complete expression is one
predicate. Different sources cannot place signals on the same element, so an
ELTID-grain cross-source conjunction or negation is degenerate; disjunction adds
nothing over a relation projected to `EVTID` or `PATID`. The former claim that
ELTID values never repeat across sources was not a valid domain guarantee.

**Change.** The implementation comment, error, README, design note, handwritten
operator help, and current-contract assertion now state and pin this rationale.
No combine, projection, or payload logic changed.

**Verification.** All 46 current-contract expectations pass, and the Phase 0
oracle is unchanged in all four cases. A full source build, including both
vignettes, passes; `R CMD check --no-manual --no-build-vignettes` finishes with
`Status: OK` and executes both vignette sources successfully.

**Files changed.** `R/spec.R`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
`tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`, `man/operators.Rd`, and this entry.

## Phase 1.10 spec preflight before source preparation (2026-08-22)

**Decision.** `run_protocol()` resolves every variable spec after validating the
protocol list and its names, but before preparing any source. An authoring error
anywhere in the protocol must fail before cohort-wide normalization begins.

**Change.** One preflight `lapply(variables, resolve_variable_spec)` now precedes
`.prepare_execution_sources()`. `run_variable()` deliberately resolves again at
execution time: resolution is cheap, and keeping the preflight independent avoids
a second internal execution path or a new contract for pre-resolved variables.

**Verification.** A disposable probe traced source preparation to fail with
`PREP_CALLED` and supplied a semantically invalid second spec. Before the change,
`PREP_CALLED` won; afterwards the selector/channel incompatibility failed first,
proving that preparation was not reached. All 46 current-contract expectations
pass, and the Phase 0 oracle is unchanged in all four cases. A full source build,
including both vignettes, passes; `R CMD check --no-manual
--no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: OK` and executes both vignette
sources successfully. No mock-only permanent test was added.

**Files changed.** `R/run_variable.R` and this entry. Output values, source
preparation, and the public authoring API are unchanged.

## Phase 2 explicit channel scope and deterministic output type (2026-08-22)

**Decision.** Every `use_channel()` activation must declare
`search_within = "PATID"` or `"EVTID"`. Windows filter dates inside that
relation; neither a window nor the output grain may infer it. `ELTID` remains a
legitimate `combine_channels(by = "ELTID")` key for aliases of one source, but is
not a search scope. Deterministic `from_channel(value = ...)` must also declare a
zero-length vector `ptype`; LLM output omits both `value` and `ptype` because its
`TypeObject` already declares the result schema.

**Change.** `search_within` is now a required `use_channel()` argument, the old
structured-channel prohibition is gone, and `.channel_scope_keys()` is a lookup
instead of the two window/output-grain fallbacks. Deterministic empty tasks get a
typed missing value from `ptype`, non-empty scalar results are cast to it with
`vctrs`, and the exact prototype is retained in the execution manifest. Package
fixtures and examples were re-authored once for both breaking authoring changes:
stay-local examples use `EVTID`; patient histories and patient-level tasks use
`PATID`.

**Verification.** The current-contract suite passes all 48 expectations,
including explicit rejection of a missing scope and a missing deterministic
`ptype`, and verifies a double missing value for an empty numeric task. The four
Phase 0 differential cases are unchanged against `after-1.10.rds`. A full source
build creates both vignettes, and `R CMD check --no-manual
--no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: OK`, including tests, documentation,
and execution of both vignette sources. A static scan of the adjacent local Git
and Desktop project roots found no `use_channel()` or `from_channel()` callers
outside this repository.

**Files changed.** `DESCRIPTION`, `R/operators.R`, `R/spec.R`,
`R/run_variable.R`, `tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`,
`tools/differential-oracle/fixtures.R`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
`vignettes/getting-started.Rmd`, `man/operators.Rd`, `man/variable_spec.Rd`, and
this entry.

## Phase 3 deterministic results without channel coverage (2026-08-22)

**Decision.** Deterministic execution publishes its value, operational
`selection_status`, evidence, and counts without translating executor states into
`values$channel_coverage`. A returned deterministic run completed; an execution
error remains fail-fast and does not become an output row. The existing LLM
whole-frame output is outside this phase and retains its current coverage/review
fields.

**Change.** Single-channel membership, deterministic `from_channel()`, gated
payloads, hit-set combines, and `audit$overlap` no longer construct
`complete`/`partial`/`failed` coverage labels. Deterministic membership reduces
executor facts directly to observed TRUE/FALSE/NA hit vectors. The historical
no-candidate status semantics are retained only inside the LLM membership
reducer rather than leaking into deterministic assembly.

**Closed executor relation.** Coverage must contain exactly one row for every
declared task and no foreign task. Missing tasks now fail instead of becoming
`no_eligible_source`; an unknown `processing_state` fails instead of falling
through to `unavailable`. `channel_status$selection_status` remains public for
the whole phase, as required by the plan.

**Verification.** All 53 current-contract expectations pass, including the
absence of deterministic `channel_coverage` and loud failure for missing tasks
and unknown states. The four Phase 0 differential cases are unchanged against
`after-phase2.rds`. A full source build creates both vignettes, and `R CMD check
--no-manual --no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: OK`, including tests,
documentation, and execution of both vignette sources. A static scan of adjacent
local Git and Desktop project roots found no external R, Rmd, or qmd consumer of
`channel_coverage`.

**Files changed.** `DESCRIPTION`, `R/channel-combine.R`, `R/hitset.R`,
`R/operators.R`, `R/run_variable.R`, `tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`,
`tools/differential-oracle/README.md`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
`man/extractionengine-package.Rd`, `man/run_variable.Rd`, and this entry.

## Phase 3b caller-owned LLM transport (2026-08-22)

**Decision.** Provider, model, and model parameters are execution dependencies,
not variable-authoring fields. One caller-constructed Ellmer Chat serves every
LLM activation in a `run_variable()` or `run_protocol()` call. A study needing
different models splits its variables across calls over the same cohort and
source snapshot; no local/default/override precedence is introduced.

**Change.** `model` and `model_params` were removed from `use_channel()`, resolved
channels, and the execution manifest. The package no longer constructs Ollama
Chats, approves model names, or reads `ALLOW_UNGATED_MODEL`. LLM execution now
requires an explicit `chat`; deterministic execution still needs none. Direct
and protocol runs validate this dependency before cohort or source preparation,
and task execution continues to deep-clone and clear the supplied Chat.
Provider, model, and parameters actually observed remain in `audit$llm_calls`.

**Verification.** All 54 current-contract expectations pass, including loud
failure for an LLM variable without a Chat and absence of declared-model fields
from the manifest. The four Phase 0 differential cases are unchanged against
`after-phase3.rds`. A full source build creates both vignettes, and `R CMD check
--no-manual --no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: OK`, including tests,
documentation, and execution of both vignette sources. No real model call was
made.

**Known downstream migration.** `C:\Users\franc\Desktop\demo extractionengine.R`
still asserts and uses `model`/`model_params`; it also retains older authoring
surface from earlier phases, so it needs a separate end-to-end refresh rather
than a Phase 3b-only substitution. The adjacent `- recovered.R` copy is older
still. Both are outside this repository and were inspected but not modified.

**Files changed.** `R/spec.R`, `R/extract.R`, `R/run_variable.R`,
`tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`, `tools/differential-oracle/fixtures.R`,
`README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`, `vignettes/structured-text-with-llm.Rmd`,
`man/variable_spec.Rd`, `man/run_variable.Rd`, and this entry.

## Desktop demo realigned through Phase 3b (2026-08-22)

The canonical external demo at
`C:\Users\franc\Desktop\demo extractionengine.R` now follows the current
authoring and execution contracts. Concept ownership moved from
`variable_spec(concept =)` to each named `use_channel(concept =)`, all 16
activations declare `search_within`, and the five deterministic
`from_channel(value =)` outputs declare their `ptype`. The structured-text
example no longer declares model configuration in the variable: it constructs
one Ollama Chat at execution and passes it to `run_variable(chat =)`. Its API
sentinels and `snippet_ids` terminology were updated with the same changes.

The deterministic path was sourced against this checkout with
`options(extractionengine.demo_llm = FALSE, extractionengine.demo_n = 3L)`.
All internal assertions passed for eight variables over three stays. The only
warning was the existing `corpustools` whitespace-trimming notice; no patient
identifier or clinical text was printed. The real LLM path was not executed.
`demo extractionengine - recovered.R` remains untouched as an older recovery
artifact.

## Phase 4.1 scoped source roster (2026-08-22)

**Boundary.** This is the first Phase 4 slice, not the relational-core rewrite.
It changes only the universe used when `combine$by` is finer than the final
output grain. Equal-grain decisions and coarse-to-fine broadcasts still use the
declared task relation.

**Change.** A source-qualified roster is built once from the prepared sources of
the run and reused by every protocol variable. Every referenced activation
restricts it through the existing `search_within` resolver and its authored
window; those scoped unit sets are intersected before the boolean expression is
evaluated. At `ELTID`, only the common source domain participates. Pre-retrieved
text inputs are marked non-enumerable and fail for a fine-grain combine rather
than supplying an incomplete complement. The execution manifest records unit
counts by source and `PATID`/`EVTID`/`ELTID` level.

**Sentinel.** A synthetic biology case proves that `!a & !b` can qualify an
existing stay hit by neither selector, while the same old stay is excluded by a
window. A Lucene case proves that biology elements do not enter the complement
of two document channels.

**Still open.** The six executor frames, the unified long relation, LLM prompt
artifacts, and lazy payload execution remain Phase 4 work.

**Verification.** All 59 current-contract expectations pass. The four Phase 0
differential cases remain identical to `after-phase3b-final.rds`. A full source
build creates both vignettes, and `R CMD check --no-manual
--no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: OK`, including tests,
documentation, and execution of both vignette sources. No real model call was
made.

**Files changed.** `R/data.R`, `R/run_variable.R`,
`tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`,
`man/operators.Rd`, `man/run_variable.Rd`, `man/variable_spec.Rd`, and this
entry.

## Phase 4.2 activation lineage (2026-08-22)

**Boundary.** This is the first vertical slice of the common relational core,
not the complete executor rewrite. It normalizes the artifacts that survived
activation selection and later processing; upstream `pre_selector` and `window`
rows still reach audit through the temporary executor-specific counters.

**Relation.** `audit$lineage` contains one coordinate-only row per activation
artifact. `stage` is the furthest stage reached (`selected`, `model_input`,
`used`, or `cited`), not an event log, so a cited snippet is not copied three
times. `artifact_type` distinguishes prepared `source_row` coordinates from
task-local `snippet` IDs. Target grain keys remain separate from
`source_PATID`/`source_EVTID`/`source_ELTID`; `source_row_ref` resolves against
the caller-owned source input and `artifact_position` preserves prompt order.
No prepared-source payload is copied into the relation.

**Authoritative consumers.** `channel_status$selection_status`, terminal
selector/model-input counts, and fine-grain combine key placement now read
lineage rather than `candidates`, `model_candidates`, or `evidence` separately.
The old `audit$internal` bundle and its complete copies of executor frames were
removed. Public values, statuses, and evidence are unchanged.

**Sentinel.** The structured case records three biology source rows at `used`.
The bounded LLM case records one cited snippet, one candidate left at `selected`,
and one uncited prompt item at `model_input`; the audit counts remain 3 selected
and 2 model inputs. A cited snippet keeps its original prompt position.

**Still open.** Executors still construct their legacy coverage/value/candidate/
evidence/observation frames during the run. Phase 4 must next move upstream
eligibility/window facts into the common relation, then make that relation the
executor contract and use it to schedule payload lazily.

**Verification.** All 65 current-contract expectations pass with no warnings.
The four Phase 0 differential cases remain identical to
`after-phase3b-final.rds`. A full source build creates both vignettes, and
`R CMD check --no-manual --no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: OK`,
including tests, documentation, and execution of both vignette sources. No real
model call was made. A same-shaped 500-task/2,500-row numeric payload probe
returned a 1.7 MB result with exactly 2,500 lineage rows; this is a diagnostic,
not a performance contract.

**Files changed.** `R/lineage.R`, `R/run_variable.R`,
`tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`,
`vignettes/getting-started.Rmd`, `man/run_variable.Rd`, and this entry.

## Phase 4.3 upstream activation lineage (2026-08-22)

**Boundary.** The common relation now covers source eligibility and windowing;
this does not yet replace every executor frame or schedule payload lazily.

**Change.** Structured activations place every task-associated prepared row in
lineage at `pre_selector`, advance window survivors to `window`, and let later
selection/contribution stages supersede those rows. Canonical tCorpus retrieval
does the same for searchable documents, which remain distinct from the snippets
they generate. `audit$counts` now derives `pre_selector` and `window` from this
relation, including explicit zero counts for tasks with no artifacts. The old
coverage-column count adapter and text-specific upstream counters were removed.

Pre-retrieved text remains intentionally different: it is a stored query result,
not an enumerable source snapshot, so it starts lineage at snippets and does not
fabricate upstream document coordinates. Its manifest roster remains marked
non-enumerable.

**Still open.** Executor `coverage` remains the total task-state relation, and
structured `observations` still supplies the pre-filter `selector` count when an
activation has row/group filters. Those contracts must be replaced explicitly;
an occurrence-only lineage cannot represent why a task has zero rows. Lazy
payload execution follows that consolidation.

**Sentinels.** A windowed biology case distinguishes one pre-window-only row,
three window survivors, and two used rows while preserving counts 6/5/4/2. A
task with no source rows still publishes `pre_selector = 0`. A real Lucene case
keeps two document artifacts separate from the two snippets they produce.

**Verification.** All 68 current-contract expectations pass with no warnings.
The four Phase 0 differential cases are unchanged from `phase4-lineage.rds`.
A full source build creates both vignettes, and `R CMD check --no-manual
--no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: OK`, including tests,
documentation, and execution of both vignette sources. No real model call was
made.

**Files changed.** `R/lineage.R`, `R/structured.R`, `R/run_variable.R`,
`tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`,
`vignettes/getting-started.Rmd`, `man/run_variable.Rd`, and this entry.

## Phase 1.3 data mask closed (2026-08-22)

**Boundary.** This closes the last open Phase 1 item and the only known defect
that published a false value. It changes how names resolve inside authored
expressions. It does not photograph the R session: `.env$` stays the explicit
escape hatch, and recording those values in the manifest remains Phase 5.

**Change.** In `filter_rows`, `filter_groups`, and the `from_channel()` value, a
bare name is a prepared-source column. The validator walks outward to the first
lexical binding and ignores the name only when that ordinary binding contains a
function, so `mean` handed to `vapply()`, an operator handed to `Reduce()`, and
authored helpers stay author code. It does not skip a nearer scalar to find a
same-named function farther out, and it does not force active or lazy bindings.
Every other object the session happens to bind, including values, option lists,
and `T`, is now reported as a missing prepared-source column, and the error names
`.env$` as the migration.

**Why not the pure deletion.** Deleting the environment branch outright turns
every function passed by value into a missing column and breaks
`vapply(split(NUMRES, ELTID), mean, numeric(1))`, the mean-of-per-stay-means
idiom the README recommends. The rule is a subtraction plus one condition, as
PLAN 1.3 specified.

**Migrations.** The suite's `weighted.mean(NUMRES, WEIGHT, na.rm =
weight_options$remove_missing)` became `.env$weight_options$remove_missing`: an
option list is a fourth migration category next to `T`, not an exemption. No
README, DESIGN, or vignette expression used the fallback. The break is recorded
in `NEWS.md`, and the contract sentence was corrected in `README.md`,
`DESIGN.md`, `man/variable_spec.Rd`, and `vignettes/getting-started.Rmd`, which
all still said that `.env` merely *disambiguates* an external value.

**Sentinels.** With `NUMRE5 <- -1` bound in the calling session,
`mean(NUMRE5)` now fails as a missing prepared-source column instead of
publishing `-1` with three genuine laboratory rows attached to it as evidence.
The same test keeps an authored per-stay mean helper compiling. A nearer
`mean <- -1` is not mistaken for `base::mean`, and a separate safety test proves
that reference discovery does not execute an active binding.

**Verification.** All 72 current-contract expectations pass with no warnings.
The seven Phase 0 differential cases are unchanged from `after-realign.rds`.
A full source build creates both vignettes, and `R CMD check --no-manual
--no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: 1 NOTE`, including tests,
documentation, and the R code of both vignette sources. No real model call was
made.

**One wrinkle, recorded rather than branched around.** R lazy-loads package
exports, so an attached package's function that nothing has used yet is a
delayed binding, and passing it *by value* inside a data-masked expression is
reported as a missing column: *[misurato]* `vapply(NUMRES, kable, numeric(1))`
right after `library(knitr)` reports `kable`, and the same expression is clean
once anything has forced that binding. It fails loudly and never publishes a
wrong value, the escape hatch is `.env$kable`, and calling the function as
`kable(...)` is unaffected because call heads are never data. Forcing package
bindings but not user promises would remove the session-dependence, and it is
deliberately not implemented: no authored expression in this repository passes a
package export by value, and the rule for that branch would be harder to state
than the wrinkle it removes.

**Where pandoc lives on this machine.** `R CMD build` renders the vignettes only
when pandoc is reachable, and it is not on `PATH`: it ships inside Positron, at
`C:/Program Files/Positron/resources/app/quarto/bin/tools`. Point
`RSTUDIO_PANDOC` and `PATH` at that directory before building from a shell
outside Positron, or the build stops at "creating vignettes" and a check run on
the vignette-less tarball adds two spurious `inst/doc` warnings.

**The one NOTE predates this change.** Check reports *"Problems with
news in 'NEWS.md': No news entries found."* Verified by running
`tools:::.build_news_db_from_package_NEWS_md()` on `NEWS.md` as committed at
`accf3dd`: it also returns NULL. R's parser rejects the heading
`# extractionengine (development version)`; with `# extractionengine 0.1.0` the
same file parses into five entries. One line, outside Phase 1.3, left for the
owner because it asserts what 0.1.0 is.

**Files changed.** `R/structured.R`, `tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`,
`NEWS.md`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `man/variable_spec.Rd`,
`man/operators.Rd`, `vignettes/getting-started.Rmd`, `PLAN.md`, and this entry.

## Phase 4.4 scoping: retiring coverage and observations (2026-08-22)

**Goal.** Replace the two executor frames Phase 4.3 left in place: `coverage`,
the total task-state relation, and `observations`, which still supplies the
pre-filter `selector` count. Lazy payload execution stays out of this slice.

**What the code actually says.** All three structured executors compute the same
two things in the same shape *[verificato: `R/structured.R:485`, `:617`, `:764`]*:

```r
processing_state = case_when(n_source_rows == 0L ~ "no_eligible_source",
                             <post-window count> == 0L ~ "no_candidate",
                             TRUE ~ "measured")
accepted_value   = if_else(<match count> > 0L, "present", "absent")
```

and `.deterministic_hits_for_tasks()` then folds those four states and two
values back into three outcomes. Composing the two collapses the whole chain:

> - no artifact ever reached `pre_selector` for the task -> `NA`;
> - at least one artifact reached `selected` -> `TRUE`;
> - otherwise -> `FALSE`.

`no_candidate` and `measured`+`absent` are the same answer arrived at twice, and
`no_eligible_source` is "zero `pre_selector` rows" spelled as a label. The
deterministic half of `coverage` is therefore **two counts over lineage**, not a
vocabulary. `values$normalized_value`/`accepted_value` go with it.

**The LLM half is a join of two relations that both already exist.**
`final_coverage` *[`R/extract.R:595-607`]* left-joins `attempts` onto retrieval
coverage and flattens the pair into one `processing_state`. Retrieval facts
(`no_eligible_document`, `no_candidate`) are lineage counts; call facts
(`not_called`, `model_error`, `processing_error`, `valid`, `invalid`) are rows of
`attempts`, already published as `audit$llm_calls`. The slice deletes the join
and reads the two relations, which is also the honest shape: retrieval and the
model call are not one state machine.

**`observations` needs one new stage, and it buys more than parity.** A row that
matched the selector and was then demoted by `filter_rows`/`filter_groups` is
today indistinguishable in lineage from a row that never matched: both stop at
`window`. Adding **`selector`** between `window` and `selected` makes the
pre-filter boundary `reached(selector)`, retiring the last read of
`observations` *[`R/run_variable.R:1480-1485`]*, and makes *what the filters
removed* visible per artifact instead of only as a count difference.

**Measured.** On four synthetic shapes over one three-patient source -- no
window; a window that keeps one row of two; a window that empties every task; a
`filter_rows` predicate -- the derived rule reproduces both published relations
exactly. `values$value` and `channel_status$selection_status` agree in all four,
including the patient with no source rows (`unavailable`, no lineage row at all)
and the task emptied by its window (`no_match`, `pre_selector` rows only). The
same runs exhibit the gap this slice must close: under `filter_rows`, the
demoted row sits at `pre_selector` beside a row that never matched the selector,
which is exactly what the new `selector` stage separates.

**The one fact lineage cannot hold.** A pre-retrieved text input is a stored
query result, not an enumerable snapshot: zero snippets can mean "no document
existed" or "documents existed and none matched", and the engine cannot tell
them apart. Today the caller declares it in `coverage$coverage_state`
*[`R/run_variable.R:94-141`]*. It stays declared, as an explicit per-task
eligibility **input**, never an executor output. This is the same boundary the
roster already draws by marking those inputs non-enumerable.

**Public surface.** `channel_status$selection_status` keeps its three labels and
its meaning: `unavailable` becomes "no artifact reached `pre_selector`" (or the
declared ineligibility, for pre-retrieved text), `matched`/`no_match` stay the
`selected` count. PLAN Fase 3 required that this column survive until its
replacement exists; the derived view is that replacement, so this slice does not
remove it.

**Acceptance criteria.**

1. no executor returns `coverage`, `observations`, or `values$accepted_value`;
2. the seven differential cases are unchanged -- this slice is behaviour
   preserving, not a contract change;
3. `audit$counts` keeps every stage it publishes today, with `selector` now
   derived from lineage for structured activations with filters;
4. a task with zero source rows and a task whose window excluded everything stay
   distinguishable in the published result;
5. an unsupported executor state can no longer be *converted* to anything: with
   the vocabulary gone, `.check_processing_states()` and the two default
   branches of difetto K go with it.

**Sequence.** (a) add the `selector` stage and move the count; (b) derive the
deterministic three-valued hit from lineage and delete `coverage` from the three
structured executors; (c) split the LLM state into retrieval + `attempts`; (d)
turn pre-retrieved eligibility into a declared input. Each step keeps the oracle
green on its own.

**Files.** `R/lineage.R`, `R/structured.R`, `R/extract.R`, `R/retrieval.R`,
`R/run_variable.R`, `R/channel-combine.R`, plus the contract sentences in
`DESIGN.md`, `README.md`, `man/run_variable.Rd`, and `NEWS.md`.

**Open questions for the owner.**

- **Does `no_candidate` deserve to survive as a published fact?** It is
  currently indistinguishable from "measured and absent" in the value, but a
  reader may still want to know the window emptied the task. The counts already
  say it (`window` = 0 with `pre_selector` > 0); the question is whether
  anything should say it twice.
- **Estimated size:** roughly 200 lines of hand-maintained bookkeeping removed
  against maybe 60 added. Not measured -- it is an estimate from the sites above,
  and the slice should report the real number.

## Phase 4.4 implemented: coverage and observations retired (2026-08-23)

**Boundary.** The executors no longer publish a per-task state relation. Lazy
payload execution, the last Phase 4 slice, is untouched, and `evidence`,
`candidates`, and `attempts` keep their contracts: this slice removes
bookkeeping, not data.

**What moved.**

- **A new lineage stage, `selector`,** between `window` and `selected`. An
  artifact that matched the channel selector and was then demoted by
  `filter_rows`/`filter_groups` stops there instead of being left at `window`,
  where it was indistinguishable from one that never matched. This retired the
  last read of `observations`; `audit$counts` publishes the same numbers,
  now read from the relation.
- **The three structured executors** no longer build `coverage`, `values`, or
  `observations`, and no longer summarise tasks at all. Membership is the two
  counts the scoping entry measured: no artifact at `pre_selector` is `NA`, at
  least one at `selected` is `TRUE`, everything else is `FALSE`.
- **Text retrieval** returns what it retrieved. `.run_lucene_presence()` returns
  no state, and the LLM path's `final_coverage` join is gone: the model-call
  half is read from `attempts` by `.llm_call_states()`, which is the same
  `case_when()` minus the two retrieval branches it had been fused with.
  `not_called` now covers "nothing retrieved" and "no documents at all"; both
  already produced identical public output.
- **`run_extraction()` takes the declared task frame** instead of coverage.
  Coverage had a third, undocumented role there: it was also the task row handed
  to `prompt_builder()`, so the prompt was being built from a state frame rather
  than from the tasks.
- **Pre-retrieved text declares its eligibility.** The caller-facing
  `coverage_state` input is unchanged; the engine reduces it once to a per-task
  boolean and reads it through `.activation_eligibility()`. It is the only fact
  in the slice that is authored rather than observed, which is the same boundary
  the roster draws by marking those inputs non-enumerable.

**One intentional behaviour change.** *[misurato]* against this checkout's `HEAD`
with a `list(corpus =, docs_index =)` bundle whose index names a document the
corpus does not contain: that task reported `selection_status = "no_match"`
before and reports `"unavailable"` now. Eligibility is what the activation could
actually search, and a document outside the corpus cannot be searched; the old
label claimed a search that never happened. Published values are identical,
because the hit-set algebra treats an unobserved channel and an observed absence
alike. Unreachable when the documents source is a bare tCorpus, whose index is
derived from the corpus itself.

**Guards traded, not dropped.** `.states_for_tasks()` and
`.check_processing_states()` went with the vocabulary they policed, and so did
the two tests that pinned them. Two executable invariants replace them: model
attempts must hold at most one row per task, and a declared eligibility must
cover every task. The lineage itself is now the total task relation, so a result
that lost it fails loudly instead of reporting every task unavailable.

**The open question is answered by construction.** `no_candidate` does not
survive: with the vocabulary gone there is no longer a place where it could be
said a second time. `audit$counts` still says it, as `pre_selector` > 0 with
`window` or `selector` at 0.

**Size.** *[misurato]* 286 lines deleted against 170 added under `R/`, a net
116 fewer. The scoping estimate was ~200 against ~60: the deletion was larger
than estimated and the replacement wordier, mostly comments carrying the
reasoning that used to be implicit in the state names.

**Verification.** All 73 current-contract expectations pass with no warnings.
The seven Phase 0 differential cases are unchanged from `after-realign.rds`,
including `text_llm`. A full source build creates both vignettes, and
`R CMD check --no-manual --no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: 1 NOTE`,
the pre-existing `NEWS.md` heading. No real model call was made.

**Still open in Phase 4.** Lazy payload execution, plus the two end-of-phase
decisions: lineage growth measured on a real profile, and whether the
incomplete-roster guard can be relaxed for expressions that cannot qualify an
invisible unit.

**Files changed.** `R/structured.R`, `R/run_variable.R`, `R/extract.R`,
`R/channel-combine.R`, `R/retrieval.R`, `R/lineage.R`, `R/globals.R`,
`tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`, `NEWS.md`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
`man/run_variable.Rd`, and this entry.

## Phase 4.5 lazy payload: the gate decides before the payload runs (2026-08-23)

**Boundary.** The last Phase 4 slice, and defect E. It changes when an
activation runs, not what any activation computes.

**Change.** A payload activation named by `from_channel()` and **not** referenced
by `combine_channels()` contributes nothing to the qualifying decision, so it
now waits for the gate and runs only on the tasks the gate qualified. A payload
activation the combine **does** reference defines the gate and still runs first,
over every task. The deferral lives in `.hit_set_expr_variable()`, the only
place that knows the gate: it runs the pending activation the moment the
membership vector exists, then rejoins it in declared order so status, evidence,
and audit read the same as if it had never been deferred.

**Why this needed the relational core first.** Restricting an activation is now
just passing it fewer tasks, and the result records which tasks it ran for. That
was not expressible while a per-task state frame had to be total over the cohort:
a `coverage` row was owed for every task, so an activation could not decline to
answer for one. Removing the state frame in 4.4 is what made the restriction a
subtraction instead of a new mode.

**The skip is published, not hidden.** An excluded task reports
`selection_status` and `processing_status` as `not_executed` and carries no
`audit$counts` and no `audit$lineage` rows for that channel. A zero count there
would claim a search that never happened, and `no_match` would claim a selection
that was never evaluated.

**A boundary the sentinel found, not the design.** Pre-retrieved text inputs are
declared against the whole cohort, but a deferred activation runs on a subset,
and the input validator rejected the cohort's own tasks as "outside the declared
cohort". Validation now happens against the cohort and the restriction after it:
`.run_selected_channel()` takes both the tasks it executes and the tasks the run
declared. The first version of this slice passed the test suite and failed this
case; the sentinel is the only reason it surfaced.

**Eligibility became execution-aware.** `.activation_eligibility()` reports a
task the activation never ran for as ineligible, so its hit stays `NA` rather
than becoming an observed `FALSE`; `channel_status` is what distinguishes "no
universe to search" from "not run". `.activation_executed()` fails loudly on a
result that does not record its executed tasks, so the fact cannot be omitted by
a future executor.

**Measured.** 2 000 tasks, a gate qualifying 10 % of them, deterministic
payload: payload lineage rows fall 6 000 -> 600, the returned result 4.70 ->
4.10 MB, elapsed 3.86 s -> 3.77 s. The time is unchanged within noise, which is
the honest result: the Phase 1 profile already showed the structured executor is
~2 % of a run. The saving that matters is the model: on the LLM path the call
count goes from one per task with candidates to one per **qualifying** task.

**Sentinels.** A new test block runs a gated payload twice. The deterministic
case proves that a task owning a payload row the selector would have matched is
skipped when the gate excludes it, publishes `not_executed`, and gets no counts
or lineage, while the qualifying task publishes its value unchanged. The LLM
case gives both tasks a retrieved snippet, qualifies one, and asserts that
exactly **one** model call was made.

**Verification.** All 78 current-contract expectations pass with no warnings.
The seven Phase 0 differential cases are unchanged from `after-realign.rds`.
A full source build creates both vignettes, and `R CMD check --no-manual
--no-build-vignettes` finishes with `Status: 1 NOTE`, the pre-existing `NEWS.md`
heading. No real model call was made.

**Phase 4 is complete.** What remains are the two decisions the plan deferred to
the end of the phase: measuring lineage growth on a real profile, and whether
the incomplete-roster guard can be relaxed for expressions that cannot qualify
an invisible unit.

**Files changed.** `R/run_variable.R`, `R/lineage.R`,
`tests/testthat/test-current-contracts.R`, `NEWS.md`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
