# operators.R -- experimental operators / helpers
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Generic reusable computational pieces used INSIDE a variable_spec or template:
# windows, combiners, output types, and extraction methods. These are
# operators/helpers, NOT variable templates (a variable template is
# concept-specific; these are not). Each is a thin tagged record the runner reads
# by class/kind.
# =============================================================================

# --- relative windows ---------------------------------------------------------
# The ratified spelling is a plain vector on each use_channel() activation:
# window = c(from_days, to_days) relative to the variable anchor (0 = the anchor
# day; negative = lookback;
# c(-Inf, 0) = unbounded lookback; NULL = no window at all). The old ctors
# (days_after / before_anchor) were wrapper-razor casualties (DESIGN invariant
# 33): they interpreted nothing the two numbers do not already say. use_channel()
# normalizes the vector into the internal ee_window record the runner reads.

# --- derived anchors ----------------------------------------------------------
# An anchor may be a cohort COLUMN (anchor = "inclusion_date", one date supplied
# per output unit)
# or DERIVED from an event. index_event() is the GENERIC derived anchor -- DESIGN §14's
# transplant_date()/surgery_date() are domain-specific forms of it: per subject, find the
# event in `source` whose `code` matches `selector`, and anchor at its `at` date
# COLUMN. `at` names the source's own column (e.g. "DATEACTE", "DATENT", "DATSORT")
# -- owner ruling 2026-07-07: role vocabulary is indirection the engine never
# interprets here, and raw names are self-documenting; the registry's roles stay
# internal where the engine does interpret them. Omitted, `at` defaults to the
# source's windowing clock (its registered source_time_start). run_variable
# resolves it in an anchor PASS -- producing (PATID, anchor_date) before
# windowing, NOT an inter-channel dependency.
#
# `select_event` is the researcher's rule for a subject with SEVERAL matching
# events (DESIGN §7 / invariant 35): a plain closure over the subject's matched
# rows (columns PATID, EVTID, and the `at` date column, e.g. DATEACTE), returning
# the row(s) that anchor the clock -- e.g. \(d) dplyr::slice_min(d, DATEACTE,
# n = 1) for "the first surgery", or identity for "every surgery starts its own
# clock" (one task per selected event; output$group_by must then be the event key).
# It may filter or reorder only those matched rows; changing an EVTID/date pair is
# not selection. Without it, multiple matches stay a loud error: the engine never
# picks.

# --- payload value -------------------------------------------------------------
# A deterministic from_channel() value is one data-masked expression evaluated
# over the aligned prepared-source rows of each final task. It is the equivalent
# of one dplyr::summarise() expression and must return exactly one cell.

# --- cross-channel combiner ---------------------------------------------------
# The ONLY cross-channel combine is hit-set algebra. A single channel has no
# hit-algebra, so it carries combine = NULL and its value is shaped by output (a
# channel payload or membership). There is no separate reconciliation combiner:
# single-channel assembly is reached with from_channel().
#
# The expression and the identity level where its signals must coexist form one
# contract:
#   combine = combine_channels(
#       "(transplant_act | transplant_status) & !dialysis_signal",
#       by = "EVTID"
#   )
# Channel-name symbols + the operators | (union) & (intersection) ! (complement)
# + parentheses; nothing else. Parsed + grammar-checked at construction; channel
# symbols are checked against the variable's activated channels at variable_spec
# build. The decision is OBSERVED hit-set algebra (a task is a member of a channel's
# set iff hit == TRUE; FALSE and NA both mean "no observed hit"), so it is always
# determined (included / excluded) -- an unavailable channel is reported via
# channel_coverage, not propagated into the decision. The per-channel audit keeps the
# raw TRUE/FALSE/NA. The pure parser/evaluator/overlap live in R/hitset.R.
