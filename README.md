# extractionengine

> `extractionengine` is the auditable executor of a study's operational
> definitions, not the author of those definitions.

The package executes explicit study-variable specifications over prepared EDSAN
views. It returns values together with operational selection facts, inspectable
evidence, and execution provenance. The researcher owns the clinical definition
and its scientific interpretation; `redsan` owns source normalization; `ellmer`
owns model transport and structured output.

The package is experimental and currently intended for internal use. Its API is
allowed to break when a clearer execution contract is found. It contains no
patient data or exported clinical concepts.

## Start here

New users should begin with
[`vignette("getting-started", package = "extractionengine")`](vignettes/getting-started.Rmd).
It builds one auditable variable from synthetic data, translates the relational
contract to dplyr, and explains the result and audit objects.

For structured text extraction, continue with
[`vignette("structured-text-with-llm", package = "extractionengine")`](vignettes/structured-text-with-llm.Rmd).
It separates Lucene retrieval from LLM interpretation, defines the response with
an Ellmer TypeObject, and explains grounding, failure state, and model audit.

## One complete authoring workflow

Assume `cohort` contains `PATID + EVTID`, `bio` is a prepared biology view, and
`documents` is a metadata-rich `corpustools::tCorpus`. A concept only locates
source rows. It does not decide which source column becomes the result or how
those rows are interpreted.

```r
anemia <- concept_spec(
  name = "anemia",
  channels = list(
    hb = lab_channel(
      selector = analyte("NGR.NGR-HB-GDL")
    ),
    text_anemia = text_channel(
      selector = lucene_query("anemi*")
    )
  )
)
```

`lab_channel()` defaults to the logical source `"biology"`; another registered
lab source can be named with `source =`. `analyte()` selects `TYPEANA` rows and
nothing else. It does not infer which prepared-source columns a published value
should use.

The variable activates concept channels explicitly. The list name is the alias
used by combine expressions, output, inspection, and provenance. A named channel
is paired with its owning `concept =`; an inline channel definition is already
self-contained and omits `concept`. Neither form can point to another activation
alias. Because the concept belongs to each activation rather than to the whole
variable, one variable may compose channels from several reusable concepts.

```r
mean_hb_for_patients_with_anemic_stays <- variable_spec(
  name = "mean_hb_for_patients_with_anemic_stays",

  channels = list(
    text_anemia = use_channel(
      channel = "text_anemia",
      concept = anemia,
      search_within = "PATID",
      method = "lucene"
    ),
    hb = use_channel(
      channel = "hb",
      concept = anemia,
      search_within = "PATID"
    ),
    hb_low = use_channel(
      channel = "hb",
      concept = anemia,
      search_within = "PATID",
      filter_rows = NUMRES < ifelse(PATSEX == "F", 12, 13)
    )
  ),

  combine = combine_channels(
    "text_anemia & hb_low",
    by = "EVTID"
  ),

  output = from_channel(
    "hb",
    group_by = "PATID",
    value = mean(NUMRES, na.rm = TRUE),
    ptype = double(),
    filter_by_qualified = "PATID"
  )
)

hb_result <- run_variable(
  mean_hb_for_patients_with_anemic_stays,
  cohort = cohort,
  sources = list(biology = bio, documents = documents)
)
```

Here `filter_rows` runs separately inside each task after relational, window, and
selector filtering. It is evaluated in a data mask where prepared-source columns
are available as bare names and must return one logical per row; `NA` is treated
as `FALSE`, and surviving rows stay intact. Use `.data[[column]]` for a
programmatically selected column and `.env$threshold` to disambiguate an external
value. `filter_groups`, paired with `use_channel(group_by =)`, is evaluated in
the same data mask and must return one non-missing logical per group while
retaining all surviving rows of accepted groups. That `group_by` is an
intermediate grouping used only by `filter_groups`; it is not the final output
grain. The mandatory `group_by` in `bin_output(group_by = ...)` or
`from_channel(group_by = ...)` independently defines that terminal grain.
An activation may also declare `window = c(from_days, to_days)` relative to the
variable's shared `anchor`; other activations remain unwindowed.
Every activation also declares `search_within = "PATID"` or `"EVTID"`; this is
the source-row boundary for each task, independently of window and output grain.
For deterministic `from_channel()`, `ptype` declares the result type, supplies a
typed missing value for empty tasks, and rejects values that cannot be cast to it.

A character anchor names an exact `Date` or `POSIXt` column supplied by the
cohort. For example, a stay-grain cohort may carry `PATID`, `EVTID`, and
`admission_date`, and the variable may declare `anchor = "admission_date"`.
When a window consumes that anchor, every output unit must retain one
unambiguous, non-missing date after cohort projection. The engine copies it to
the internal task clock; it does not look for that column in a channel source.

Alternatively, `index_event()` derives the clock from the registered source it
names, before any channel runs. It currently accepts a code selector created by
`icd10()` or `ccam()`; `at` names the source's real date column (or defaults to
its registered clock), and `select_event` must resolve multiple matches by
selecting rows from that matched relation. It may filter or reorder those rows,
but cannot alter or invent an `EVTID`/date pair. This anchor resolution is
independent of the variable's activated channels.

The relational declarations answer different questions:

- `search_within = "PATID"` makes the patient's source rows eligible before
  channel selection or retrieval; their native `EVTID`, when present, can still
  support a finer combine; every activation must declare `"PATID"` or `"EVTID"`;
- `combine_channels(..., by = "EVTID")` requires the text and low-Hb signals to
  coexist in a stay;
- `filter_by_qualified = "PATID"` lets the value expression see all Hb rows of each
  qualified patient; changing it to `"EVTID"` restricts the mean to qualifying
  stays;
- `group_by = "PATID"` publishes one final row per patient.

`by` names the unit where the whole expression is evaluated as one predicate.
Two sources cannot place signals on the same element, so a cross-source combine
at `by = "ELTID"` has no useful relational grain: conjunction and negation are
degenerate, while disjunction adds nothing over combining after projection to
`EVTID` or `PATID`. It therefore fails at build time. A combine at `by = "ELTID"`
may still relate different activations or selectors resolving to the same
registered source, and a payload may consume those keys at `ELTID` only from
that same source.

`filter_by_qualified` is admitted, and required, only when `combine$by` is finer
than `output$group_by`; it may then be only the combine key or the output key.
It must be `NULL` when there is no combine, the grains are equal, or a coarser
combine is broadcast to finer output units. A channel may be payload-only: `hb`
feeds `from_channel()` even though only `text_anemia` and `hb_low` occur in the
combine expression. Here *payload* simply means the source data selected for
publication; it is not a hidden engine column.

### Why the qualifying-row filter and output grain are different

The subtle case is a combine evaluated at a finer key than the final output,
followed by a `from_channel()` value expression. Suppose one patient has two stays:

| PATID | EVTID | Hb values | Combine result |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | E1 | 8, 10 | qualifying |
| P1 | E2 | 14, 16 | not qualifying |

With `combine_channels(..., by = "EVTID")`, the combine answers only that E1
qualifies. With `group_by = "PATID"`, the output must ultimately publish one
value for P1. Those declarations still leave two scientifically different
questions.

To ask *what is the patient's mean Hb in qualifying stays?*, restrict the input
rows by the combine key:

```r
from_channel(
  "hb",
  group_by = "PATID",
  value = mean(NUMRES, na.rm = TRUE),
  ptype = double(),
  filter_by_qualified = "EVTID"
)
```

This is relationally equivalent to:

```r
hb_rows |>
  semi_join(qualified_evtids, by = c("PATID", "EVTID")) |>
  group_by(PATID) |>
  summarise(value = mean(NUMRES, na.rm = TRUE))
# P1: mean(c(8, 10)) = 9
```

To ask *among patients with at least one qualifying stay, what is the patient's
mean Hb across all stays?*, restrict by the output key instead:

```r
from_channel(
  "hb",
  group_by = "PATID",
  value = mean(NUMRES, na.rm = TRUE),
  ptype = double(),
  filter_by_qualified = "PATID"
)
```

This first projects the qualifying stays to their patients, then filters the Hb
rows:

```r
qualified_patids <- qualified_evtids |>
  distinct(PATID)

hb_rows |>
  semi_join(qualified_patids, by = "PATID") |>
  group_by(PATID) |>
  summarise(value = mean(NUMRES, na.rm = TRUE))
# P1: mean(c(8, 10, 14, 16)) = 12
```

Both routes correctly produce one row per PATID. Execution always follows
`combine by -> filter by qualified -> group by -> evaluate value`, and the three
declarations answer separate questions:

- `combine$by`: where is qualification decided?
- `filter_by_qualified`: rows from which qualified units feed the value expression?
- `output$group_by`: at which key is the final result grouped and published?

The payload channel's public evidence follows the same qualified-row relation:
it cannot include rows from units excluded before grouping. The complete
pre-gate channel intermediate remains available under `audit$internal`.

The filter must be `NULL` when there is no combine, when
`bin_output(group_by = ...)` publishes membership directly, when combine and
output use the same key, or when a coarser combine is broadcast to a finer
output grain.

An LLM response is already one row per output task. When it is used as a
fine-to-coarse payload, `filter_by_qualified` must therefore equal
`output$group_by`; lower-level LLM payload scope would require one model call per
lower-level key and is not implemented.

For a deterministic channel, `value` is one data-masked expression evaluated on
the complete, aligned prepared-source rows of each final group. It can therefore
use several columns, for example `weighted.mean(NUMRES, WEIGHT, na.rm = TRUE)` or
`NUMRES[which.max(DATEXAM)]`. Missing values are not removed automatically: the
expression owns its `NA` policy. If no payload row remains, the expression is not
evaluated and the engine publishes the typed missing value declared by `ptype`.
Otherwise it must return
exactly one cell: one atomic scalar or one list cell. Longer or dimensional
results are cardinality errors. A row containing both `NUMRES` and `STRRES` is
valid because the authored expression makes their use explicit.

The value expression is terminal: `group_by = "EVTID"` with
`value = mean(NUMRES, na.rm = TRUE)` computes one stay mean, while
`group_by = "PATID"` pools the patient's raw rows. `filter_by_qualified` filters
rows before that grouping and evaluation; it does not implement a mean of stay
means. Such a two-stage aggregation requires an explicit derived variable and is
intentionally future work.

## Structured text extraction

LLM-specific fields are declared directly with a native `ellmer::TypeObject`.
The concept still only locates candidate text:

```r
tabagisme <- concept_spec(
  name = "tabagisme",
  channels = list(
    text_tabagisme = text_channel(
      selector = lucene_query("taba*")
    )
  )
)

tabagisme_levels <- c("actif", "sevre", "non_fumeur", "indetermine")

tabagisme_enum <- variable_spec(
  name = "tabagisme_enum",

  channels = list(
    text_tabagisme = use_channel(
      channel = "text_tabagisme",
      concept = tabagisme,
      search_within = "EVTID",
      method = "lucene_llm",
      response = ellmer::type_object(
        "Extraction structurée du statut tabagique.",
        statut_tabagique = ellmer::type_enum(
          tabagisme_levels,
          paste(
            "Statut explicitement documenté;",
            "ne jamais déduire non_fumeur du silence."
          )
        )
      )
    )
  ),

  output = from_channel("text_tabagisme", group_by = "EVTID")
)

chat <- ellmer::chat_ollama(
  model = "gemma3:4b",
  params = list(temperature = 0, seed = 42)
)

smoking_result <- run_variable(
  tabagisme_enum,
  cohort = cohort,
  sources = list(documents = documents),
  chat = chat
)
```

`from_channel("text_tabagisme", group_by = "EVTID")` publishes the complete
structured frame: every authored TypeObject field plus `rationale` by default.
An LLM output omits `value`; field projection is not part of this output
contract. In `use_channel()`, `rationale = TRUE` or omission uses:
“Justification brève du choix, fondée uniquement sur les extraits et sans ajouter
d'information non documentée.” A non-empty string overrides that description;
`FALSE` or `NULL` omits the field.

Provider, model, and model parameters belong to execution rather than to the
variable specification. The caller constructs one Ellmer Chat and supplies it
to `run_variable()` or `run_protocol()`; the engine never constructs or approves
a provider. To use different models in one study, split the variables across
multiple `run_protocol()` calls over the same cohort and source snapshot.

The package-level system prompt contains only general structured-extraction
instructions and can be overridden with `system_prompt =`. The engine constructs
the user prompt from the target and numbered excerpts; `user_prompt =` is an
optional prefix for cross-field instructions. Variable-specific meaning belongs
in the TypeObject and individual `type_*()` descriptions.

Before `chat_structured()`, the engine adds `rationale` and a `snippet_ids` enum
limited to the snippets actually shown. Those names, grain keys, and audit fields
are reserved and cannot collide with authored fields. Evidence identifiers are
resolved to the evidence table rather than published as JSON columns. No manual
`json_format` is used.

A completed response is valid only when at least one returned evidence ID
resolves to a supplied snippet. Mixed real and invented IDs keep the grounded
result, discard the invented IDs, and raise a citation warning. A response with
no real ID is invalid and publishes typed missing fields plus review state while
retaining its raw response in the audit.

Retrieval retains identical wording from distinct native source units for
relational evidence. Before applying `max_candidates`, the LLM prompt separately
keeps one canonical occurrence of each normalized hit sentence per task (or
normalized snippet text for pre-retrieved inputs without `hit_text`), so repeated
documents do not crowd distinct excerpts out of a bounded prompt.

Pre-retrieved text inputs are a test/debug boundary and must describe a possible
retrieval result: `coverage_state` uses the three canonical states, and a task has
candidate rows if and only if its state is `candidate`.

An LLM response does not implicitly define boolean channel membership. A
`lucene_llm` activation may be published with `from_channel()` (including as a
payload gated by a deterministic combine), but it cannot currently appear in
`combine = combine_channels(...)`. Compilation fails with an explanatory error
until an explicit response-to-hit rule such as `hit_when` is implemented. Use
`method = "lucene"` when Lucene-hit presence itself is the intended membership
signal.

No candidate, model failure, or invalid schema still yields a stable result row
with typed missing fields and separate selection/processing information. Raw
response and provenance remain auditable. A grounded LLM response publishes
only the snippets it cited, marked as `evidence_kind = "llm_citation"`; its
`snippet_id` is local to that task's prompt.

`run_variable()` returns only `values`, `channel_status`, `evidence`, and
`audit`. `channel_status` has one row per output task and activated channel. Its
stable core identifies the output unit, variable, channel, and source, then
records two independent controlled fields:

- `selection_status` is `matched`, `no_match`, or `unavailable`: respectively,
  one or more candidates survived activation selection, selection completed
  with no surviving candidate, or no reliable selection could be made;
- `processing_status` is `not_required` for non-LLM channels. For
  `lucene_llm`, it is `completed`, `not_called`, `invalid`, or `failed`:
  respectively a valid grounded response, no model invocation, an unusable
  returned response, or a call/processing failure.

Deterministic `values` contain the authored result, not a derived
`channel_coverage` label. A returned deterministic run completed; whether rows
were available or selected remains visible through `selection_status`, evidence,
and `audit$counts`. Whole-frame LLM outputs retain their existing coverage and
review fields until the LLM contract is revised.

`evidence` has one row per retained evidence occurrence. `evidence_kind`
distinguishes `source_row`, `lucene_hit`, and `llm_citation`. Structured evidence
preserves prepared-source columns such as `TYPEANA`, `NUMRES`, `STRRES`, and
`DATEXAM` when available. `evidence_ref` is an opaque coordinate local to the
executed run and source snapshot, not a globally stable warehouse identifier;
the same source evidence may legitimately recur for different targets or
channels. Internal `source_row_id` and `hit_ref` identifiers are not public.
When a row carries a native `EVTID`, it is published as `source_EVTID`; an output
`EVTID` remains the target stay. The two may be equal without being semantically
interchangeable.

`run_protocol()` accepts either an entirely unnamed variable list or an entirely
named one whose names exactly equal each `spec$name` in the same order. Canonical
names must be unique, and the returned result list is always named from
`spec$name`; an R binding such as `local_name <- variable_spec(name = "canonical",
...)` never changes the public identifier.

The audit contains a tidy `counts` table with output-grain keys plus `channel`,
`stage`, `unit`, and `n`. Its stages describe the following counts when the
corresponding executor emits them:

| `stage` | What `n` counts |
|---|---|
| `pre_selector` | structured source rows, or searchable text documents, associated with the task before window and selector |
| `window` | those rows or documents remaining after the activation's time window |
| `selector` | rows or snippets matching the channel selector |
| `filtered_selector` | selector matches remaining after row and group filters |
| `model_input` | snippets supplied to the model |
| `output_input` | prepared-source rows supplied to the terminal value expression |

Stages are included only when that executor records a distinct count. Their
absence alone does not prove that an operation did not run.

`llm_calls` contains one row per task/channel model invocation. `call_status`
records the model/transport outcome, `response_status` records whether the
returned response could be processed, and `task_validity` records grounding and
schema acceptance; `transport_attempts` counts the underlying call tries. The
table also retains model configuration, timing, prompt/schema/query fingerprints,
diagnostics, and the raw or partial response, with the same columns when it has
zero rows. A task that never reaches the model, for example because it has no
candidate, has no call row. The
`execution_manifest` is a resolved snapshot of what was configured and executed,
not a chronological activity log. Combination runs additionally keep `overlap`,
a tabular Venn/UpSet-style count of observed `TRUE`/`FALSE`/`NA` channel patterns,
and `combine_keys`, the key-level relation evaluated at `combine$by`, including
each channel's membership and the final `qualifies` decision. `overlap` is
computed from task-level hit patterns; it is not an aggregation of
`combine_keys`.

Executable and debugging details are explicitly separated under
`audit$internal` as `resolved_spec` and `channel_intermediates`. Printing
`audit$execution_manifest` gives a compact author-facing summary; its complete
resolved fields remain directly addressable for programmatic audit.

`bin_output(group_by = ...)` remains the output for source membership or a
combine result. A deterministic `method = "lucene"` activation never creates a
Chat.
